## [Component Templates Co-location RFC 🖇️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/481)

[@chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) opened an RFC around placing the component’s class and template in the same directory on the file system. The proposed change is to move the templates from being located at `app/templates/components` into the `app/components` directory, co-locating it with the component’s JavaScript file.

This change provides component class/template coupling, a single source of truth for components, resolves deviations from route template conventions, and the lack of a single import. If you'd like to learn more, please take a look at [RFC #481](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/481). Read, comment, and spread the word about it! 🖊️

This CLI tool can **find unused translations** in your component files. Soon, it will be able to **find broken and missing translations** too!
