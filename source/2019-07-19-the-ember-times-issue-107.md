## [Custom Configuration of Ember Auto Import for Your Project ⏬](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/tree/v1.3.0#customizing-build-behavior)

[Ember Auto Import](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-auto-import), a very useful addon, helps you easily **import** and use third-party JavaScript libraries from **npm** in your Ember app.

You can [configure the addon to fit your project's specific needs](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#customizing-build-behavior). By providing the `autoImport` configuration object in your app options defined in `ember-cli-build.js`, you can, for example, change the name of the packages to import from or exclude packages to be imported with Ember Auto Import, which you might have already provided to your app in another way.

If you're already an avid user of Ember Auto Import (or plan to become one), be aware that from version 1.4.0+ the addon will **no longer include** Webpack's polyfills for a set of Node.js globals and modules automatically.

[When upgrading to a version of the addon beyond 1.4.0](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#i-upgraded-my-ember-auto-import-version-and-now-things-dont-import-what-changed), you might see errors such as `global is not defined` in your app or test suite. This might indicate that some of your packages—even though they run in a browser environment—still rely on globals (these are usually only available in a Node environment) and may require a polyfill to work correctly. You can check [this issue on the Ember Auto Import repo](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/218) for more context.


If you want to opt-in to these Node polyfills using Ember Auto Import, you can [configure them accordingly](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/224#issuecomment-503400386) via the `autoImport` options in your `ember-cli-build.js`:

```
// ember-cli-build.js
let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  autoImport: {
    webpack: {
      node: {
        Buffer: false,
        global: true,
        process: true,
      },
    }
  }
});
```

You can review the configuration defaults for the Node.js polyfill over at [the documentation for Webpack itself](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/#node).
