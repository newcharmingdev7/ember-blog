This week we'd like to highlight the work of community member **Bek**, also known as [@bekzod](https://github.com/bekzod).
In an exclusive interview with the Ember Times they talk about their learnings as a **contributor** to the **Ember.js framework** and why contributions can have an impact on thousands of people.

 You can read the full interview on [the Ember Forum](#link-to-forum).
