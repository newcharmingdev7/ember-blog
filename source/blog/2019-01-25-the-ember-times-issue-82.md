## [New RFC: Accessible Routing in Ember üó∫](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/433)
Currently, routing in Ember is not natively accessible for users with assistive technology. This means that whenever the user navigates to a new route within an Ember application, screen readers do not read out the new content or appropriately move focus. This new RFC by [@MelSumner](https://github.com/MelSumner) proposes a solution to this so **Ember routing can be natively accessible for users with assistive technology**.

Feel free to read the [RFC](https://github.com/MelSumner/rfcs/blob/MelSumner-a11y-routing/text/0000-a11y-routing.md) and leave your thoughts as a comment.
