## [Coming Soon: Angle Brackets to the Guides üéâ](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/139)

A [quest issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/139) to convert the guides to **angle bracket invocation** is gaining traction. This effort will bring [RFC 311](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md) to the documentation in the next few weeks, which is nice since this is a feature that has been available in Ember for some time! Many thanks to the contributors involved in this effort. üëè

 <div class="float-right padded portrait-frame"><img alt="Bek" title="Bek - Contributor to Ember" src="/images/blog/emberjstimes/bekzod.png" /></div>

This week we'd like to highlight the work of community member **Bek**, also known as [@bekzod](https://github.com/bekzod).
In an exclusive interview with the Ember Times they talk about their learnings as a **contributor** to the **Ember.js framework** and why contributions can have an impact on thousands of people.

 You can read the full interview on [the Ember Forum](#link-to-forum).
