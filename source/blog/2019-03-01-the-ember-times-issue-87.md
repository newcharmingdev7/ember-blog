## [Ember 3.8 Released 🚀](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html)

New versions of Ember, Ember CLI and Ember Data have been released. Not only does this release contain features like the **Element Modifier Manager and the array helper** - it also marks 3.8 as a new LTS candidate. Both the features and the LTS information can be found in the [release post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html).

This release also contains 5 deprecations for Ember, so if you plan on upgrading to 3.8 please have a look at the [new deprecations](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html#toc_deprecations-5).

## [Contribution Guides in FCP! 🖊️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/446)

[@jessica-jordan](https://github.com/jessica-jordan) proposed adding an official **Contribution Guide** which aims to improve the discoverability of Ember-related projects that require help by the community and outlines the general contribution workflow for these projects.

With the intent of making the Contribution Guides as beginner-friendly as possible, it will include a **summary** of the motivation of open-source and its meaning for Ember as an OSS project, a real-world example of **how to contribute code**, a guide on **how to file an issue**, and an **issue finder** inspired by the [What Can I Do for Mozilla landing page](https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/).

<!--alex ignore retext-profanities-->
The [Contribution Guides RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/446) is in Final Comment Period (FCP) so check it out!
