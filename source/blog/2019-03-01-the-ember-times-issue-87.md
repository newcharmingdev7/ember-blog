## [Ember 3.8 Released 🚀](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html)

New versions of Ember, Ember CLI and Ember Data have been released. Not only does this release contain features like the **Element Modifier Manager and the array helper** - it also marks 3.8 as a new LTS candidate. Both the features and the LTS information can be found in the [release post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html).

This release also contains 5 deprecations for Ember, so if you plan on upgrading to 3.8 please have a look at the [new deprecations](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html#toc_deprecations-5).

## [RFC for Single-File Components & Template Import Primitives](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/454) 🔬
[@tomdale](https://github.com/tomdale) recently opened up an RFC to explore adding single-file components and module imports in component templates!

The **SFC & Template Import Primitives RFC** proposes adding experimental low-level primitives for embedding templates in JavaScript and associating templates with component classes, two highly-requested features. 🎉

Rather than proposing specific formats for single-file components and template imports, the RFC proposes new low-level API's that addons can use to implement experimental 🧪 file formats.

Be sure to checkout and comment on the detailed design of the [SFC & Template Import Primitives RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/454) on Github!
