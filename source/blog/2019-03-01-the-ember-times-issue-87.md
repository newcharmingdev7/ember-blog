## [Ember 3.8 Released 🚀](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html)

New versions of Ember, Ember CLI and Ember Data have been released. Not only does this release contain features like the **Element Modifier Manager and the array helper** - it also marks 3.8 as a new LTS candidate. Both the features and the LTS information can be found in the [release post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html).

This release also contains 5 deprecations for Ember, so if you plan on upgrading to 3.8 please have a look at the [new deprecations](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html#toc_deprecations-5).

## [Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC 🕳](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/451)

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) opened an RFC around making `getOwner` and explicit injections work in classic class constructors since the [Native Class Constructor Update RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0337-native-class-constructor-update.md) changed the way that classic classes were constructed.

The Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC proposes to make _explicit_ injections work for the class’s constructor method. However, _implicit_ injections will still only be available during `init`, because they are passed in and assigned as `args`. The _implicit_ injections will be caught using development-mode assertions which would direct users to add the injection explicitly (ideally), or to use `init`.

Read the full details on the [Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/451) on GitHub!
