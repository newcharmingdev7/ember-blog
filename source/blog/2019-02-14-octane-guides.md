Octane is coming soon, and with all this work comes a lot of documentation. Since this requires coordination of many moving parts, we want to outline the approach we're taking, and outlining some ways that the community can contribute. 

## Preparation

In order to prepare for the new edition, the Learning Core Team spent time figuring out how to best transition the existing docs in such a way that was consistent with iterative innovation. 

- Jen's RFC
- Infrastructure support

## Updating the guides
As per the usual standard, we have planned out this work to be able to complete it in an iterative fashion. This was particularly important because we are updating guides as new features for the Octane release are merged into Ember. 

### Phases
These are the phases of the work: 
- Reorder the TOC as per the RFC
- Add in new sub-sections
- Accept PRs for content in each sub-section
- Edit & re-arrange before preview launches
- Add re-direct URLs and remove old content
- launch! 

### Challenges
- converting concepts from classic syntax to new syntax
- what to do about temporarily needed guides

## How you can help
- https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/projects/4
- Coordinate in #dev-ember-learning

### Future of Contributing
