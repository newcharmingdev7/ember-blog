Hallo Emberistas! üêπ

This week we have: Final Comments on **RFC RFCeption** ü§î, upvotes for the **Ember Subreddit** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, a guide to start writing **components you'll love** üíñ, a How-To for **building** your own painting **game** üé®, a sneak peek at the **new Ember CLI guides** üìñ and a reminder to watch the first season of **EmberFest 2018** üçøüìΩ!

---

## [New Guides for Ember CLI üìì](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/)
There's a **new and improved version of the Ember CLI guides out**. [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) has been championing moving the Ember CLI guides into the Ember domain with enhanced content.

There will be a more formal launch of the new Ember CLI guides on the [Ember blog](https://emberjs.com/blog/) but since you're **an Ember Times subscriber**, [you get a sneak peek](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/).

If you find any typos or bugs, then please feel free to report it to the [new repository](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides).

## [The RFC RFCeption ü§î](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300)
<!--alex ignore period-->
The RFC (Request For Comments) about the [RFC Process](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300) itself is in its **final comment period**!

The current RFC process is great but has a few quirks. For example, there are different processes for [emberjs/rfcs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs) and [ember-cli/rfcs](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs). If you haven't taken a look yet; this RFC proposes joining together all RFC processes, requiring a [Core team](https://emberjs.com/team/) Champion for RFCs that are accepted and more.
Check it out and join the [discussion](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300)!

## [Have You Read the Ember Subreddit? ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/)
In case you didn't know Ember.js has its own [Reddit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/)! It is another media channel where people can participate and share **Ember-related** things! It recently got a facelift and a new Ember brand theme.

The community has decided that we want to revive this subreddit and get it active. We want to get something about Ember on the front page but we need your help!

If you are wondering where to start check out [What Are You Working On (Nov 2018)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/comments/9yycbi/what_are_you_working_on_nov_2018/) and tell us what Ember things you have been doing in the month of November.

If you have any questions about the subreddit itself or want to help out hit up the new mods [@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) or [@Alon](https://github.com/Alonski) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS).

So **subscribe** to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/) today, post some content and upvote üÜô what you love!
