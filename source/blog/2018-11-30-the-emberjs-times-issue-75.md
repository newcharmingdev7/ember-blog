## [SECTION TITLE](#section-url)
There's a **new and improved version of the ember-cli guides out**. [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) has been championing moving the ember-cli guides into the ember domain with enhanced content. 

There will be a more formal launch of the new ember-cli guides on the Ember-blog but since you're **an Ember Times subscriber**, [you get a sneak peek](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/).

If you find any typos or bugs, then please feel free to report it to the [new repository](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides).
