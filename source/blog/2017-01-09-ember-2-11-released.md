Today, the Ember project is releasing Ember.js, Ember Data and Ember CLI
version 2.10.0.

This also kicks off the 2.11 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our
community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report
any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The
[ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to
continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.
