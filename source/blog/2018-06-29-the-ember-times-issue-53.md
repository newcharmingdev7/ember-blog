Mholweni Emberistas! 🐹

Read either on the [Ember blog](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/29/the-ember-times-issue-53.html) or in our [e-mail newsletter](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/2018/06/29/the-ember-times-issue-53) what has been going on in Emberland this week.

And this week we not only have an insider tip on how to dramatically **reduce** your **app build times** 🕐 for you,
but we're also reporting back on **easy-peasy module imports** 🙌 and - last, but not least! - presenting you a **brand-new Readers' Question** 💯 in this edition of the Ember Times. Check it out 🐹:

## [Need for Speed: Ember Edition - Speed Up Ember Builds](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/7645)

Have Ember CLI build times been causing you *grief*? Do you want to shave 20 seconds from your rebuilds?

[Tomasz Smykowski](https://github.com/tomaszs) has been experimenting with building on [SSD vs RAM Disk](https://emberjs-developer.quora.com/How-to-make-Ember-js-CLI-ember-s-32-times-faster). He has seen up to **32x** speed improvements! Speedups were found when upgrading to a faster processor and using an SSD.

Upgrading RAM wasn't found to be helpful however the biggest gain was found by using a RAM disk to hold the project folder which allowed 3x speed gains during builds. The drawback of this is that when the computer shuts down the RAM disk is wiped clean (so make sure you commit often!).
[Tobias Bieniek](https://github.com/Turbo87) chimed in that current efforts to integrate Broccoli 2 into Ember CLI are underway and that most platforms would get this speedup by default once the usually RAM Disk powered, system temporary folder instead of the current _in-project_ `tmp` folder is used due to the Broccoli update.

Look for this speedup soon in an Ember App near you!

## [Oh, No(de) He Didn't!](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import)
[Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4) has just released version 1.0 of `ember-auto-import`. This addon allows you to add dependencies using NPM or Yarn with zero configuration. It can be used both in apps and addons and deduplicates correctly across all addons and the app itself.

All you have to do is type `ember install ember-auto-import` and you’re ready to add whatever dependency you want to your project using NPM or yarn.

Read all about the version 1.0 release on the [forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-auto-import-1-0-released/14997).
