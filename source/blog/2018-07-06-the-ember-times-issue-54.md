## [Organising the Organisers](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/30/organizing-our-contributors.html)
The Ember Team has published a new blog post outlining some structural changes to the Core teams. It contains two changes: A new Steering Committee and a renaming of some of the existing teams.

The Steering Committee will be responsible for areas like community guidelines, managing Ember‚Äôs brand, dealing with legal questions and much more. 

The renaming of the Ember teams means that moving forward, all the official teams will be known as Core teams: Ember.js Core, Ember CLI Core, Ember Data Core, and Ember Learning Core.

The intent here is to make it clear that all members of the teams are peers.

You can read all about the changes in the [Ember blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/30/organizing-our-contributors.html)
