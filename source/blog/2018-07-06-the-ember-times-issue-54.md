## [Organising the Organisers](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/30/organizing-our-contributors.html)
The Ember Team has published a new blog post outlining some structural changes to the Core teams. It contains two changes: A new Steering Committee and a renaming of some of the existing teams.

The Steering Committee will be responsible for areas like community guidelines, managing Ember‚Äôs brand, dealing with legal questions and much more. 

The renaming of the Ember teams means that moving forward, all the official teams will be known as Core teams: Ember.js Core, Ember CLI Core, Ember Data Core, and Ember Learning Core.

The intent here is to make it clear that all members of the teams are peers.

You can read all about the changes in the [Ember blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/30/organizing-our-contributors.html)

## [Twiddle Your Thumbs No More](#section-url)

[Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/) support for the latest (v3.2.2) release of Ember and Ember Data is here! With the great efforts of [@Guarav0](https://github.com/Gaurav0), [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) and [@gokatz](https://github.com/gokatz) you can now use the latest and greatest in Ember Land in your favorite browser Ember environment. 

Some cool updates are new keyboard shortcuts for `run now` and `save` as well as a shortcut for quickly commenting javascript code.
There are also some updates to the contribution guide and of course it now supports Ember 3.0 - 3.2 out of the box!

Ember Twiddle, currently at `v0.15.0` is a great tool that allows creating simple Ember apps to showcase ideas, bugs, issues, demos and more. It allows using addons with the included `twiddle.json` and has a built-in generator just like Ember-CLI. There are even different keyboard layouts such as Vim, Emacs, Sublime and more.

Now is a great time to check out this amazing tool!
