## [Pointy single word components available üëà](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill)

Since last Monday single word component names are now possible with the **angle bracket invocation syntax**.

Invoking components via angle brackets was already available, the novelty is that you can now use this syntax with single word components as well.

For example, the polyfil supports components names such as `<Button>`, `<Modal>` and `<Tab>`.

To find out more, check out the relevant RFC section [here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#tag-name)
