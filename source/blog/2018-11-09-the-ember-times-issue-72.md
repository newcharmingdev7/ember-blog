## [JSConf EU CFP is Now Open! üëê](https://2019.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/)

[JSConf EU](https://2019.jsconf.eu/), which will be held from **June 1‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâ2 2019 in Berlin**, has officially opened their call for papers for a talk regarding JavaScript, the web, or a clever hack.

<!--alex ignore blind-->
This is a good opportunity for us, as Ember developers, to **showcase our work to the greater JavaScript community**. Similar to the [EmberConf process](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/10/12/the-ember-times-issue-68.html#toc_a-href-https-emberconf-com-become-a-speaker-html-emberconf-2019-call-for-papers-a), the papers starts out blind and later gets de-anonymized.

The call for speakers this year is **open until December 23rd**. JSConf‚Äôs sibling conference, CSSconf, even published a blog on [How to write a great talk proposal for a tech conference](https://blog.cssconf.eu/2014/06/12/how-to-write-a-great-talk-proposal-for-a-tech-conference/).

_‚ÄùPick the topic you feel most passionate about. This is your conference.‚Äù_  is the JSConf EU saying so [apply to be a speaker](https://2019.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/) today!

## [Personalize Your Route's Metadata with the RouteInfo Metadata RFC üìù](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/398)

Have you ever wanted to **track** specific keywords for a particular route in your Ember app, but didn't know how to do so in an elegant fashion? Have you tried to update the `document.title` of a page depending on the specific point of time at which a route was visited, but realized that this couldn't be done without some effort?

Then a brand-new **Request for Comments (RFC)** is just for you! The proposal [_RouteInfo Metadata_](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/398) suggests a new way for reading and writing **application-specific metadata** to the corresponding _RouteInfo_ object. For more context on which information routes currently provide, be sure to also check out [the section about the RouteInfo type from the original RouterService RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0095-router-service.md#routeinfo-type).

And finally, read the full _RouteInfo Metadata_ proposal to learn more and leave your thoughts and questions in the [comments below the proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/398).

## [Premier League Video Tutorial ‚öΩÔ∏è](https://twitter.com/gavinjoyce/status/1059533557130059779)

[@GavinJoyce](https://github.com/gavinjoyce) made an awesome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=vYakop2d2RI) where he walks through how to build a live updating league table in the **latest Ember 3.5**! Code along with the video and you'll use [ember-cli-tailwind](https://github.com/embermap/ember-cli-tailwind) for styling, angle bracket components, `shuffle` from [ember-composable-helpers](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers) (TIL), [ember-math-helpers](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-math-helpers) and more.

Check out [ember-league-table.surge.sh](ember-league-table.surge.sh) to run the app and the [repo](https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-league-table) for the source code. Our advice? Share the tutorial with a friend, whether they call it football or soccer...
