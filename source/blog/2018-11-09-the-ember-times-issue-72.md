## [JSConf EU CFP is Now Open! üëê](https://2019.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/)

[JSConf EU](https://2019.jsconf.eu/), which will be held from **June 1‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâ2 2019 in Berlin**, has officially opened their call for papers for a talk regarding JavaScript, the web, or a clever hack.

<!--alex ignore blind-->
This is a good opportunity for us, as Ember developers, to **showcase our work to the greater JavaScript community**. Similar to the [EmberConf process](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/10/12/the-ember-times-issue-68.html#toc_a-href-https-emberconf-com-become-a-speaker-html-emberconf-2019-call-for-papers-a), the papers starts out blind and later gets de-anonymized.

The call for speakers this year is **open until December 23rd**. JSConf‚Äôs sibling conference, CSSconf, even published a blog on [How to write a great talk proposal for a tech conference](https://blog.cssconf.eu/2014/06/12/how-to-write-a-great-talk-proposal-for-a-tech-conference/).

_‚ÄùPick the topic you feel most passionate about. This is your conference.‚Äù_  is the JSConf EU saying so [apply to be a speaker](https://2019.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/) today!

## [Yo Dawg, I Heard You Like RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300)
There has been an update to the RFC about the RFC process itself. The RFCs has been crucial in defining **the future of Ember** and that is still the case.
However, in the process of reading and merging all of these RFCs the Core Team has discovered some shortcomings of the current RFC process as well as new requirements.

To solve some of these issues the RFC proposes that new RFCs are assigned a **Core Champion** from the Core Team as well as merging ember-cli/rfcs into emberjs/rfcs.

There are more proposed solutions in [the RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/rfc-process-update/text/0300-rfc-process-update.md) which I recommend you read through and leave a comment with your thoughts.
