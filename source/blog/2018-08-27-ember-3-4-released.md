Today the Ember project is releasing version 3.4 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. This release kicks off the 3.5 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

## Ember.js

Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.

### Changes in Ember.js 3.4

Ember.js 3.4 is an incremental, backwards compatible release of Ember with bugfixes, performance improvements, and minor deprecations. There is one (1) new feature, three (3) deprecations, and eight (8) bugfixes in this version.

#### New Features (X)


#### Deprecations (1)

Deprecations are added to Ember.js when an API will be removed at a later date. Each deprecation has an entry in the deprecation guide describing the migration path to a more stable API. Deprecated public APIs are not removed until a major release of the framework.

Consider using the [ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) addon if you would like to upgrade your application without immediately addressing deprecations.


For more details on changes in Ember.js 3.4, please review the [Ember.js 3.4.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v3.4.0).


Use closure actions instead of `sendAction` (1 of 1)

In Ember 1.13 closure actions were introduced as a recommended replacement for `sendAction`. With `sendAction` the developer passes the name of an action, and when `sendAction` is called Ember.js would look up that action in the parent context and invoke it if present. This had a handful of caveats:

* Since the action is not looked up until it's about to be invoked, it's easier for a typo in the action's name to go undetected.

* Using `sendAction` you cannot receive the return value of the invoked action.

Closure actions solve those problems and on top are also more intuitive to use.

To read more about this deprecation and how to refactor your existing code have a look at [the deprecations page](https://emberjs.com/deprecations/v3.x#toc_ember-component-send-action).

## Ember Data

Ember Data is the official data persistence library for Ember.js applications.

### Changes in Ember Data 3.4


#### New Features (0)



#### Deprecations (0)



For more details on changes in Ember Data 3.4, please review the
[Ember Data 3.4.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v3.4.0).

## Ember CLI

Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js applications.

### Upgrading Ember CLI

You may upgrade Ember CLI separately from Ember.js and Ember Data! To upgrade your projects using `yarn` run:

```bash
yarn upgrade ember-cli
```

To upgrade your projects using `npm` run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli
```

After running the upgrade command, make sure to install (if you haven't already) ember-cli-update globally:

```bash
npm install -g ember-cli-update
```

This utility will help you to update your app or add-on to the latest Ember CLI version. You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which the default behavior is to let you resolve conflicts on your own.

## Thank You!

As a community-driven open-source project with an ambitious scope, each of these releases serve as a reminder that the Ember project would not have been possible without your continued support. We are extremely grateful to our contributors for their efforts.
