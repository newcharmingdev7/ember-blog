Sawubona Emberistas! üêπ

Read either on the [Ember blog](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/08/the-emberjs-times-issue-50.html) or in our [e-mail newsletter](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/2018/06/08/issue-50) what has been going on in Emberland this week:
We have a couple of **fresh ü•í Ember RFCs** (Request for Comments) in for you this week, a status update from the long-awaited
**Package** üì¶ feature in Ember CLI üíª, a call-to-action for creative **writers** ‚úçÔ∏è and
last, but not least, a **brand-new Readers' Question** for you üìö:

## [Lets Send SendAction Away!](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/335)
The time has come. `component#sendAction` has served the Ember community well for years but in a new [RFC by @cibernox](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/335) he proposes to deprecate this feature. In the old days, before v1.13, `component#sendAction` was the only way to bubble up actions from components. Since v1.13 we have _closure actions_ which are more intuitive and flexible and they are the current recommended Ember Way‚Ñ¢ for doing actions in components.

_Closure actions_ have been the recommended way to do actions in components for almost 3 years. Also `component#sendAction` is not even mentioned in the guides anymore so there is really little reason to keep it around. So look out for a new deprecation near you, coming soon!

If you want to learn more about why _closure actions_ are preferred over `component#sendAction` then you can check out [this blog post from 2016](http://miguelcamba.com/blog/2016/01/24/ember-closure-actions-in-depth).

## [RFC Deprecating Ember Utils](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/334)
A new RFC has been posted on deprecating `Ember.{isEmpty, isBlank, isNone, isPresent}`. The motivation of this is to clean up utils that do not provide much value over writing plain old Javascript. There's already a discussion going on whether this is a good decision or not. You can follow the discussion and read the RFC at the [RFC repository](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/334).

---

## [Global Resolver RFC in Final Process](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/331)
The RFC to deprecate global resolver is has now entered the final stage. The motivation of this RFC is the fact that we have transitioned to using Ember-CLI. The globals resolver is primarily used for Ember without Ember-CLI.

Read all about the RFC and bring your thoughts for the final process in the [RFC repository](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/331).

## [Ember CLI Packager: News from the Field üåæ](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/blob/master/active/0051-packaging.md)

We already wrote about the [Packager in Ember CLI recently](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/25/the-emberjs-times-issue-48.html#toc_a-href-https-github-com-ember-cli-ember-cli-pull-7826-a-package-out-for-delivery-to-ember-cli-a). But here's another **status update** for this
feature which will make the **build pipeline** of your Ember apps **easier to modify** very soon:
These weeks lots of new improvements and fixes landed ([1](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7864), [2](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7855), [3](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7848), [4](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7860)).
According to internal sources, there have already been **successful test runs** using the experimental version of this [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) powered packager üò≤ for bundling and tree-shaking
different open-source Ember üêπ projects.
We'll keep you posted with more news from the field soon!
