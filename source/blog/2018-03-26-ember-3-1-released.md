title: Ember 3.1 and 3.2 Beta Released
author: Ricardo Mendes
tags: Releases
---

Today the Ember project is releasing version 3.1.0 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI.

This release kicks off the 3.2 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our
community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report
any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The
[ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to
continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

## Ember.js

Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.

### Changes in Ember.js 3.1

Ember.js 3.1 is an incremental, backwards compatible release of Ember with
bugfixes, performance improvements, and minor deprecations.

#### Deprecations in Ember 3.1

Deprecations are added to Ember.js when an API will be removed at a later date.

Each deprecation has an entry in the deprecation guide describing the migration
path to more stable API. Deprecated public APIs are not removed until a major
release of the framework.

Consider using the
[ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow)
addon if you would like to upgrade your application without immediately addressing
deprecations.

Two new deprecations are introduces in Ember.js 3.1:

* TODO
* TODO

## Ember Data

Ember Data is the official data persistence library for Ember.js applications.

Ember Data 3.1 contains bug fixes and build improvements for Ember Data.

### Changes in Ember Data 3.1

#### Deprecations in Ember Data 3.1

No new deprecations are introduced in Ember Data 3.1.

For more details on changes in Ember Data 3.1, please review the
[Ember Data 3.1.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v3.1.0).


### Upcoming changes in Ember Data 3.2

Ember Data 3.2 removes [all current feature
flags](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/5384) for Ember
Data. These feature flags have gone stale and Ember Data is going to
attempt to go a different direction with some of the planned changes
for 2018. Many of these feature flags have been around for a long
time, if your app depends on enabling these feature flag to run please
reach out to the Ember Data team by opening a github issue on the
[Ember Data repo](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues) and the
Ember Data team will try to assist with the transition.

#### `ds-improved-ajax` Feature Flag
During the Ember Data 3.2 beta cycle, the Ember Data team is planning
on releasing an addon that will support the `ds-improved-ajax` API.

#### `ds-pushpayload-return` Feature Flag

If you rely on the `ds-pushpayload-return` feature flag you can use
the following pattern to manually serialize the API response and push
the record into the store.

```js
export function pushPayload(store, modelName, rawPayload) {
   let ModelClass = store.modelFor(modelName);
   let serializer = store.serializerFor(modelName);

   let jsonApiPayload = serializer.normalizeResponse(store, ModelClass, rawPayload, null, 'query');

  return store.push(jsonApiPayload);
}
```

```diff
+import { pushPayload } from '<app-name>/utils/push-payload';

...

-this.get('store').pushPayload(modelName, rawPayload);
+pushPayload(this.get('store'), modelName, rawPayload);
```

#### Deprecations in Ember Data 3.2

There are no new deprecations planned for Ember Data 3.2.

[Ember Data 3.2.0-beta.1 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v3.2.0-beta.1).
