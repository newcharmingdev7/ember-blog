## [eslint-plugin-ember v6.0.0 is out! üöì](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1062700572757946368)

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/Turbo87) announced the release of [v6.0.0](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v6.0.0) of [eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember) which is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin that provides set of rules for Ember Applications based on commonly known good practices.

This new release includes several **breaking changes** to the `ember/recommended` configuration such as [no-restricted-resolver-tests](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-restricted-resolver-tests.md) and [no-ember-testing-in-module](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-ember-testing-in-module-scope.md). Check the [release notes](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v6.0.0) for the full list of breaking changes and enhancements.

Note: If you still use [ESLint 3](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/267) or [Node.js 4](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/255) **this release will not work** for you as this major version change drops support for both of them.

## [Videos From EmberFest Are Out! üéâ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9)
The videos from EmberFest are **now available** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9). This means that you can experience all of the great talks even though you weren‚Äôt there! (And you know, if you were there you can now re-live it all).

If you don‚Äôt know where to start then we highly recommend the [opening keynote by Tom Dale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzmDobMZ_Q&t=0s&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=2) and the [closing keynote by Melanie Sumner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP-kog04lng&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=21).

Tom Dale spoke about what will happen next year when you generate a new Ember app. This involves super exciting things like the **module unification app structure**,  **angle bracket invocation**, **JavaScript classes**, **tracked properties** and much more. All of this is of course delivered with the usual Tom Dale dapperness and humor. Definitely worth a watch.

<!-- Waiting for Niels' section about Mel's talk here -->
