## [eslint-plugin-ember v6.0.0 is out! üöì](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1062700572757946368)

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/Turbo87) announced the release of [v6.0.0](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v6.0.0) of [eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember) which is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin that provides set of rules for Ember Applications based on commonly known good practices.

This new release includes several **breaking changes** to the `ember/recommended` configuration such as [no-restricted-resolver-tests](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-restricted-resolver-tests.md) and [no-ember-testing-in-module](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-ember-testing-in-module-scope.md). Check the [release notes](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v6.0.0) for the full list of breaking changes and enhancements.

Note: If you still use [ESLint 3](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/267) or [Node.js 4](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/255) **this release will not work** for you as this major version change drops support for both of them.

## [Videos From EmberFest Are Out! üéâ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9)

The videos from EmberFest are **now available** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9). This means that you can experience all of the great talks even though you weren‚Äôt there! (And you know, if you were there you can now re-live it all).

If you don‚Äôt know where to start then we highly recommend the [opening keynote by Tom Dale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzmDobMZ_Q&t=0s&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=2) and the [closing keynote by Melanie Sumner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP-kog04lng&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=21).

Tom Dale spoke about what will happen next year when you generate a new Ember app. This involves super exciting things like the **module unification app structure**,  **angle bracket invocation**, **JavaScript classes**, **tracked properties** and much more. All of this is of course delivered with the usual Tom Dale dapperness and humor. Definitely worth a watch.

Melanie Sumner delivered a thoughtful talk about how other peoples' views on something you enjoy - especially when you‚Äôre a smaller community - can create uncertainty, and why it shouldn‚Äôt. It delivers a few helpful tools and encourages us to **observe**, **analyse** and **think** before responding to critical claims. The talk is a great reminder to consider how we talk to each other and to enjoy doing what we do, no matter what others may think.

If you want to browse through all of the great talks from EmberFest, check out the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP-kog04lng&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=21).

## [Hot reloading in Ember üîÉ](https://github.com/lifeart/ember-ast-hot-loads)

[ember-ast-hot-load](https://github.com/lifeart/ember-ast-hot-loads) is a new attempt to bring components hot reloading into the Ember ecosystem!

Hot reloading only refreshes the components that were changed without losing the state of the app. For example, if you are four routes deep into your app and save a change to some component, the updated component would appear on the page without full application reload.

ember-ast-hot-load perform handlebars templates hooking using AST transformations, and replaces components invocations from
`{{my-component}}`, to `{{component (hot-load 'my-component')}}`. The `hot-load` helper now knows which component rendered and may call the recompute function, to invoke component redraw after its source code has been updated and compiled.
