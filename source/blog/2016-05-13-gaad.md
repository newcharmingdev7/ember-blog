May 19, 2016 marks the fifth annual **[Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/)** and this year we're encouraging you, the Ember.js community, to participate. We want to help make our framework, addons, and the applications we collectively build and maintain accessible to all users.

Designing and building for accessibility isn't an exercise for the few to benefit a marginalized community. It pays dividends across the entire Ember user base. Constraints in design help inform us how to create better user experiences, better experiences result in greater adoption of Ember as a framework, and the consequent growth of the Ember community is an investment in our collective future.

Earlier this year [the Ember A11y project](http://www.ember-a11y.com) was started with the goal of making Ember applications _accessible by default_. We want to enable Ember applications to move "beyond the ramp" of token accessibility and make it easy to start designing experiences for users of assistive technology. For GAAD this year we're sponsoring an effort to help you get involved.

## 2016 GAAD Activities

We're aiming to make it easy to get involved with Ember A11y's Global Accessibility Awareness Day efforts. Any and all of these are very good places to start. Addon maintainers as well as the Ember A11y community team members will be around all day to support your efforts–[drop by any of the places where we're hanging out](#toc_participate-in-the-community) and you'll find us excited to work with you. At the end of the day make sure you let us know what you worked on so that we can include it in our wrap-up email!

### Ember A11y Project

The [Ember A11y GitHub organization](https://github.com/ember-a11y/) has a collection of addons that we maintain as part of our commitment to accessibility in the Ember ecosystem. Our primary focus so far has been on functionality for [focus management](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y) as well as [testing](https://github.com/trentmwillis/ember-axe). We'd love for you to help [add features](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-template-lint/issues/41), [research issues](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y/issues/3), [address `TODO:`s in the codebase](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y/issues/9), and [test in multiple browser/assistive tech permutations](http://ember-a11y.github.io/ember-a11y/).

[The complete list of the Ember A11y project efforts you can participate in is here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q4DkaNwH8mh7xZJa1TmrHNcFuFuWdQ80iG88c7N4QII/edit#gid=808967448) 

### Community Addons

This year we've partnered with a few community addons to work on improving their accessibility bonafides. [The complete list of the community addons we've partnered with and efforts you can participate in is here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q4DkaNwH8mh7xZJa1TmrHNcFuFuWdQ80iG88c7N4QII/edit#gid=0) If you happen to use any of these addons in your own applications this is an excellent way to start contributing.

The simplest way to get started is to do an accessibility review of an addon for how well it works using assistive tech. If you discover things that don't work well with assistive technology file an issue with the `[a11y]` tag as a prefix. If you are unsure of where to start just [reach out](#toc_participate-in-the-community) and we can work with you!

### Learning About Accessibility

Accessibility is a tremendously broad space and includes everything from design to tooling to code. We've selected a few resources and presentations you can read to get started in the accessibility space.

#### Experiences

You can experience the web using assistive tech and see what it's like. Turn off your display and surf the web with a screen reader for an hour. Try using [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org/) on Windows, VoiceOver on [OS X](http://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/10.11/) and [iOS](http://help.apple.com/iphone/9/#/iph3e2e4367), or [TalkBack on Android](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en). Or better yet, all of them!

#### Resources

- A fantastic article on the tension between [accessibility guidelines and user experience](http://simplyaccessible.com/article/guidelines-vs-ux/)
- You can use [The A11y Project's Web Accessibility Checklist](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html) to guide you through an accessibility evaluation of a website.
- Addy Osmani gives [an overview of Chrome's A11y Command-line Tools](https://addyosmani.com/a11y/).
- Learn about the foundations of Web Accessibility with the [Accessibility APIs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/).

#### Presentations

Selected from the Ember community, but there are tons of wonderful presentations on this topic!

- [Accessibility Mechanics for Web Applications](https://vimeo.com/163925627) by [Léonie Watson](https://twitter.com/LeonieWatson) given at [Ember London](http://emberlondon.com/).
- [Building for Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok9v9-Tcq0o) by [Nathan Hammond](https://twitter.com/nathanhammond) and [Jennison Asuncion](https://twitter.com/jennison) (one of the co-founders of GAAD) given at [Wicked Good Ember](https://wickedgoodember.com/). [Followup blog post.](http://www.nathanhammond.com/building-for-accessibility)
- [Ben Holmes](https://twitter.com/binhums) gave a [lightning talk](http://confreaks.tv/videos/emberconf2016-minitalk-accessibility-in-ember) at [EmberConf](http://emberconf.com/).
- A talk titled [A11y Debt](https://github.com/Robdel12/a11y-debt#a11y-debt) by [Robert DeLuca](https://twitter.com/robdel12).

### Work on Your Application

Last but not least you can test your own application! We also recommend investigating adoption of [ember-a11y](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-a11y) for its focusing mechanics, adding [ember-a11y-testing](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-axe) into your CI pipeline to test for accessibility issues, as well as adopting [ember-cli-template-lint](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-template-lint) which will hopefully include linting for accessibility issues by the end of Global Accessibility Awareness Day!

## Staying Involved

Accessibility isn't a one-day-a-year project. We would love to have you around every day of the year.

### Participate in the Community

The Ember A11y community group is here to stay, and you can participate! Information about what we're working on shows up in our [fortnightly meeting notes](https://github.com/ember-a11y/core-notes/tree/ember-a11y/ember-a11y) and our nascent website, [ember-a11y.com](http://www.ember-a11y.com). We hang out in the [#topic-a11y channel](https://embercommunity.slack.com/archives/topic-a11y) on the [Ember Community Slack](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/) and some of us haunt the [Web A11y Slack/Gitter](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/07/anybody-can-be-an-a11y-slacker/). Come introduce yourself, we'd love to chat and help in any way we can!

### Stay Up-To-Date

We've set up a low-traffic email list for which you can sign up to be notified of accessibility-related topics and happenings in the Ember community. We'll also give you updates on how the Global Accessibility Awareness Day activities are going! Sign up now:
