## [Meta and Link all the Things](#https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/332)

This backwards compatible RFC allows `ember-data` users to associate optional `meta` and `links` on records alongside the top-level document `meta` (mandatory) and `links` (optional).  Sadly, `ember-data` currently stores this information only on relationships and not individual records.  The RFC design is pretty straightforward, designate that all `meta` and `links` :
	- will be honored in any resource encountered in a json-api compliant document
	- when defined on resource identifiers, for example links to resources within a relationship, will be ignored.
	- when defined on relationship objects will continue to function as they do today.
	- will be exposed as getters on instances of `DS.Model` and will default to null if nothing has been provided.
Similarly, `meta` and `links` will be exposed on instances of `DS.Snapshot`. Although `meta` and `links` are getters on `DS.Model`s, they will be exposed on `DS.Snapshot` as methods:
```js
class Snapshot {
    links() {}
	meta() {}
}
```
Interestingly, some apps have inadvertently achieved what this RFC purposes by moving `meta` and `links` into `attributes` during serialization and then exposing each of them via `DS.attr`., Therefore, this RFC gives `ember-data` an even more complete "out of the box experience" and will likely be a very welcomed addition to the library.

## [RFC for removing `Ember.Evented`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329)
There's an [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329) on removing usage of the `Ember.Evented` mixin in Ember Data specifically. This would also lead to the future removal of several lifecycle hooks and methods on `Model`s and other Ember Data classes. The use of `Ember.Evented` is mostly a legacy from pre 1.0 of Ember Data and is simply not needed anymore. You can follow the discussion and read all about the implications of this change on the [RFC pull request.](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329)

## [Recasting Call üé¨ for Templates](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast)

Are you an Ember addon author who wants to be able to change the template of host apps? Or are you an Ember developer who tinkers with templates or template-related codemods? Then, the new Ember addon [ember-template-recast](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast) is just for you.
Ember Template Recast allows you to transform templates easily in a non-destructive manner - this means, that you can modify specific parts of your templates while preserving formatting like whitespaces and linebreaks from your original template at the same time.

The `templateRecast` API is almost as straightforward as an `ember install`. Check it out:

```
const anExampleTemplate = `
{{list-item
  title="Ember"
}}`;

// create an abstraction of your template (AST)
let ast = templateRecast.parse(anExampleTemplate);

// modify your template
ast.body[0].hash[0].key = 'header';
ast.body[0].hash[0].value += ' is awesome';

// reprint your AST...
templateRecast.print(ast);

/* ...to return your modified template, formatting included üíÅüèª
	{{list-item
	  header="Ember is awesome"
	}}
*/
```

Try it out [here](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast) and transform your templates today ‚ú®
