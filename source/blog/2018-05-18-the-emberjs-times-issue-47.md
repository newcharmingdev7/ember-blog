## [Meta and Link all the Things](#https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/332)

This backwards compatible RFC allows `ember-data` users to associate optional `meta` and `links` on records alongside the top-level document `meta` (mandatory) and `links` (optional).  Sadly, `ember-data` currently stores this information only on relationships and not individual records.  The RFC design is pretty straightforward, designate that all `meta` and `links` :
	- will be honored in any resource encountered in a json-api compliant document
	- when defined on resource identifiers, for example links to resources within a relationship, will be ignored.
	- when defined on relationship objects will continue to function as they do today.
	- will be exposed as getters on instances of `DS.Model` and will default to null if nothing has been provided.
Similarly, `meta` and `links` will be exposed on instances of `DS.Snapshot`. Although `meta` and `links` are getters on `DS.Model`s, they will be exposed on `DS.Snapshot` as methods:
```js
class Snapshot {
    links() {}
	meta() {}
}
```
Interestingly, some apps have inadvertently achieved what this RFC purposes by moving `meta` and `links` into `attributes` during serialization and then exposing each of them via `DS.attr`., Therefore, this RFC gives `ember-data` an even more complete "out of the box experience" and will likely be a very welcomed addition to the library.
