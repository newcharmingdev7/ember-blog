## [Decorators in FCP ü§ì](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/408)
<!-- alex ignore period -->
The [decorators RFC](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/rfcs/blob/decorators/text/0000-decorators.md) has been moved into **Final Comment Period (FCP)**. This means that if you have thoughts about decorators now is your chance to add your comment.

The motivation for the decorators RFC is that native decorators bring a **more natural way of declaring computed properties** to native classes than the current computed macros.

As always, feel free to read the [RFC](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/rfcs/blob/decorators/text/0000-decorators.md) and share your thoughts as a comment.
