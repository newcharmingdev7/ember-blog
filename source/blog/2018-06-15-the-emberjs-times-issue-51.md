## [New release of Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com)

Ember Twiddle v0.14.0 was released on Monday June 4. It includes support for Ember 2.18, Babel 6, and new module imports.
The entire [changelog](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-twiddle/releases/tag/v0.14.0) shows all the work that has gone into this. 
The next version is also being worked on, supporting Ember 3.0 - Ember 3.2.
You can test that out now at [canary.ember-twiddle.com](https://canary.ember-twiddle.com).
Ember Twiddle is a playground website for developing small Ember applications backed by Github gists.

## [It's visibly time to deprecate isVisible üëÄ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/324)
A new RFC has been posted on deprecating `Component#isVisible`. The motivation is related to the confusion associated to setting the isVisible property on a component. Also, modern Ember applications are already avoiding using isVisible in favor of simpler conditionals in the template. Given that `Component#isVisible` is a public API, deprecating now would schedule for removal in the next major version release (4.0). 

No sweat, other options are still available to hide elements, such as:

- `<div hidden={{boolean}}></div>`
- Wrapping the component in a template conditional `{{#if}}` statement. 
- Using the Component's `classNames` and `classNameBindings`

A heads-up that this RFC has entered the FCP (Final Comment Period), so this week might be your last chance to comment on it!
