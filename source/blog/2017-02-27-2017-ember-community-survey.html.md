2016 was another exciting year to be a web developer, and a great year to be
building an Ember application. 

A few highlights from 2016:

- Ember.js [2.3 through 2.10](http://emberjs.com/blog/tags/releases.html) stable versions were released,
including two LTS releases ([Ember.js 2.4](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/04/11/ember-2-5-released.html) 
and [Ember.js 2.8](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/10/17/ember-2-9-released.html))
- [Glimmer 2](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/07/29/announcing-the-glimmer-2-alpha.html) landed in Ember.js 2.10
- The [Ember.js addon](https://www.emberaddons.com/) community grew from 2,000 to over 3,500 publicly available addons!
- The new [Engines](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/10) API was introduced in Ember.js 2.8
- [Subteams](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/05/19/introducing-subteams.html) were announced


These are just a handful of the many exciting changes last year.
In addition to some of the highlights, the Ember-CLI
team continues to make improvements to the speed and quality of our build tooling,
all while continuing to be the foundation for a growing addon community.

The addon ecosystem and other projects under the official umbrella and outside it, continue to
innovate and mature.

With 2017 already under way, we should take a moment to check our assumptions
about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework.
To that end, we're pleased to announce the official 2017 Ember Community Survey!

</a>

This is the third year for the survey. Participation grew from 900 in 
[2015]((http://www.201-created.com/ember-community-survey-2015)) to over 1,800 in 
[2016](http://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2016),
where the community shared information about themselves, their businesses, and applications.
We are hoping to continue this rising trend and get even more participation this year! 

Completing the survey should take about fifteen minutes. We will be accepting
submissions until March 21st.
