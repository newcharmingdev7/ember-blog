## [What's New in Ember Inspector üêπ](#section-url)

We've been working hard over the past few months to close out lots of
super old issues (some from several years ago!), and work on adding new
features to Ember Inspector. Thanks to [@nummi](https://github.com/nummi)
you can now more easily keep up with the changes being made as well! When
you open a new version of Ember Inspector, you'll now be shown an info tab
with all the changes since the last version.

We also did a few third party library swaps and updates, 
most notably switching from ember-pikaday to [ember-flatpickr](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-flatpickr)
and using [ember-table](https://github.com/Addepar/ember-table) for the data tab.
[@thorsteinsson](https://github.com/thorsteinsson) championed the ember-table
work and, as a result of the switch, you can now scroll the table horizontally! üéâ

Finally, we are working hard on the future of Ember Inspector, and have an RFC
up for making it extensible, which would allow for things like swapping out the
data tab to use Redux, etc. Please check out the RFC and let us know your
thoughts! [Link to RFC will go here (we haven't posted it yet)]().
