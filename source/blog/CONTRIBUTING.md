# Ember Times

The Ember Times is a blog newsletter with weekly updates from the Ember land.
It is part of the [Emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com/) website and managed by the Learning Team and friends.

## Contributing

Anyone can become an Ember times editor. The best way to start is to join #topic-embertimes channel on [Ember Community Slack](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/). New blog posts are released every Friday. 

The process to publish a new weekly post is as follows:

- The championing editor of the week creates a branch with the MD file containing next week blog post
- Editors will then pull request against that branch with changes to that file
- Once the new blog post file is complete, the newly created branch is merged back into the website
- As a last step, the content is copied over to [Goodbits](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/), which is the tool currently being used to send the newsletter and manage its subscriptions

The Reader's Questions section of the newsletter is usually answered by core team members, but anyone can give a helping hand. 
The answers are posted on [discuss.emberjs.com](https://discuss.emberjs.com/) and linked back to the weekly blog post.

A typical Git forking workflow can be used to contribute:

- Fork the repo
- Clone the repo in your own machine
- Commit changes to your own branch
- Push the changes
- Create a pull request to the new blog post branch on the original repo

To update your fork with the new weekly branch you can do:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b newblogpostbranch upstream/newblogpostbranch
git push -u origin newblogpostbranch
```
To set the upstream you can use:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/emberjs/website
```

And last but not least, you can set the origin by doing:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/website
```
