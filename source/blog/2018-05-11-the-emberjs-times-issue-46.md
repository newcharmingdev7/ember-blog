## [Deprecate globals resolver RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/331)
Gaurav Munjal has submitted an RFC to finally deprecate the globals resolver and related API. The globals resolver is primarily a holdover from when people used Ember without Ember-CLI and looks like this:

```
// app.js
var App = Ember.Application.create();

App.Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
});

App.AboutRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return ['red', 'yellow', 'blue'];
  }
});
```

```
// index.html
<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="index">
  <ul>
    {{#each model as |item|}}
      <li>{{item}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</script>
```

Using Ember-CLI instead has been recommended for years, but anyone still using this API should
read the RFC and comment on why they might still need it.

## [Get involved with the new Ember guides](https://emberguides.stonecircle.io/release/)
The Learning Team has been working on a new and improved version of the Guides app. It's now made with Ember.js and is more shiny than ever. The Guides app is almost ready for a proper release, but before we do so, we would love for you to [try it out](https://emberguides.stonecircle.io/release/). If you find any issues then please [report them](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app/issues).

Or if you feel in a particulary good mood, look through existing issues in the [Guides app](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app/issues) or the [Guides source](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues) and start contributing to the new guides.
