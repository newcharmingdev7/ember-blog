## [Ember Website Redesign 🔥](https://emberjs.com/)

Maybe you haven't noticed, but the **primary website for Ember** has been **redesigned** and it is **now live**! The redesign brings a fresh new look at the main piece of real estate for Ember on the internet and features a clean and modern look that all of us in the community can be proud of. 

This redesign has been a long time in the making and has invovled a lot of work from the people across the Ember teams and the Ember community. Big shout outs to everyone involved in the effort, especially [Mel Sumner @melsumner](https://github.com/MelSumner) and [Chris Manson @mansona](https://github.com/mansona)! 🎉🎉🎉 It's super exciting to see this modern re-visioning of the website come to life.

If you are enjoying the new website and would like to help make all the Ember web properties have a consistent design, please let the Learning Team know on Discord in the #dev-ember-learning channel. 

If you notice anything wrong with the website please also feel free to open an issue in either the [main website repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/) or the [styleguide repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide) where the components live.

## [ember-template-lint v2 released ✅](https://twitter.com/rwjblue/status/1231372429286608902)

In case you weren't aware, you can lint templates to follow Ember's recommended practices, avoid making common accessibility mistakes, and collaborate with your team more effectively. 💯

```bash
# Install (or upgrade to v2)
ember install ember-cli-template-lint

# Profit!
npm run lint:hbs
```

The v2 release was [recently announced](https://twitter.com/rwjblue/status/1231372429286608902). The most notable change may be that you can start following recommended rules for Ember Octane:

```javascript
// .template-lintrc.js
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  extends: 'octane',
  rules: {
    /* Add custom rules here */
  }
};
```

You can find the full list of updates in the [changelog](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/releases/tag/v2.0.0). Please extend your thanks to [@lifeart](https://github.com/lifeart), [@bmish](https://github.com/bmish), [@dcyriller](https://github.com/dcyriller), [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue), [@akashdsouza](https://github.com/akashdsouza), [@alexlafroscia](https://github.com/alexlafroscia), [@buschtoens](https://github.com/buschtoens), [@gojefferson](https://github.com/gojefferson), and [@initram](https://github.com/initram) for helping with v2 release!

## [2020 Ember Community Survey 📝](https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/2020-emberjs-community-survey/)

Here's another friendly reminder that it’s that time of year again 😀, the **6th annual official 2020 Ember Community Survey** is here! Once again we would love your help to learn about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework

Last year over 1200 people participated in the survey. All that participation and your participation over the years has resulted in enough input to make the process more efficient. This year the survey has been considerably slimmed down from previous years! So it should be easier than ever to make a **contribution** to our community by filling out the survey – let’s keep that participation going! 🎉

This year we’d also like to emphasize that contributions from non-Ember users are valuable as well. So if you have co-workers or friends who you think might be interested in filling out the survey, please share it with them.

Submissions will be accepted **until March 8th**, but there’s no need to wait! Go ahead and fill out the [survey here now](https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/2020-emberjs-community-survey/). 🔥🔥🔥

We look forward to your participation! If you have any immediate questions, feel free to email the survey team via survey@emberjs.com, or ping them in #dev-ember-learning on the [Discord chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs).

But please, don't forget to help us spread the word by sharing the survey landing page on your social network feeds, at meetups and around your office and other communities.
