## [Nested Components in Angle Brackets: A First Look 🔍](https://embermap.com/video/angle-bracket-components-a-first-look)

Starting Ember 3.10 (currently in beta), we can call nested components in angle brackets! 🎉🎉🎉 Recall, we want to use angle brackets to add clarity to code.

EmberMap gave us [a first look](https://embermap.com/video/angle-bracket-components-a-first-look) at the new syntax and how to incrementally migrate our templates. For example, the template,

```handlebars
{{#ui-grid columns='md:2 lg:3' gutters='md:3' as |grid|}}
  {{#each sortedEpisodes as |episode|}}
    {{#grid.column}}
      {{podcast/components/podcast-card episode=episode}}
    {{/grid.column}}
  {{/each}}
{{/ui-grid}}
```

would become,

```handlebars
<Grid @columns='md:2 lg:3' @gutters='md:3' as |grid|>
  {{#each sortedEpisodes as |episode|}}
    <grid.Column>
      <Podcast::Components::PodcastCard @episode={{episode}} />
    </grid.Column>
  {{/each}}
</Grid>
```

The best news? You don't have to wait till your app is at 3.10. Thanks to @rwjblue[https://github.com/rwjblue], you can use a polyfill[https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill] to get the full feature set of angle brackets today! 😃
