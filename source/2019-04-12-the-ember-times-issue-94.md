## [Nested Components in Angle Brackets: A First Look 🔍](https://embermap.com/video/angle-bracket-components-a-first-look)

Starting Ember 3.10 (currently in beta), we can call **nested components in angle brackets**! 🎉🎉🎉 Recall, we want to use angle brackets to **add clarity to code**.

EmberMap gave us [a first look](https://embermap.com/video/angle-bracket-components-a-first-look) at the new syntax and how to incrementally migrate our templates. For example, the template,

```handlebars
{{#ui-grid columns='md:2 lg:3' gutters='md:3' as |grid|}}
  {{#each sortedEpisodes as |episode|}}
    {{#grid.column}}
      {{podcast/components/podcast-card episode=episode}}
    {{/grid.column}}
  {{/each}}
{{/ui-grid}}
```

would become,

```handlebars
<Grid @columns='md:2 lg:3' @gutters='md:3' as |grid|>
  {{#each sortedEpisodes as |episode|}}
    <grid.Column>
      <Podcast::Components::PodcastCard @episode={{episode}} />
    </grid.Column>
  {{/each}}
</Grid>
```

The best news? You don't have to wait till your app is at 3.10. Thanks to [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue), you can use a [polyfill](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill) to get the full feature set of angle brackets today! 😃

## [User Impersonation in SaaS with Ember.js and Ruby on Rails 👤](https://codeandtechno.com/posts/user-impersonation-ember-simple-auth-doorkeeper/)

When developing SaaS (software as a service) applications, it is important to be able to log in as one of your users and see exactly what they see. This can help with debugging issues and aid your support team in assisting users. 

[@matixmatix](https://github.com/matixmatix) has created an awesome tutorial on how this can be done using Ember.js (with [Ember Simple Auth](https://ember-simple-auth.com/)) and Ruby on Rails (with [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) gem for OAuth2). 

Achieving this is a fairly simple process. Normally, a client exchanges their username and password for an access token. To impersonate that user, we would need to create the token without the user's password. We can ask DoorKeeper to issue a new token for the provided user directly. Lastly, we update our existing OAuth2 authorizer so that we can pass the token (instead of password) to log in as that user.

Read [@matixmatix](https://github.com/matixmatix)'s full [tutorial](https://codeandtechno.com/posts/user-impersonation-ember-simple-auth-doorkeeper/) to get started!

## [EmberCamp Videos are Live! 🍿](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eq2DPpyBbm-vTgHMdBjUi1Qd5GiRIfW)

Looking for some more Ember content to watch? The first batch of EmberCamp 2018 videos are now available! 

We especially enjoyed [@toranb](https://github.com/toranb)'s talk [Fast Feedback, Forward Progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX8PxE0BVjI&list=PL4eq2DPpyBbm-vTgHMdBjUi1Qd5GiRIfW&index=4) where he talks about ways to **work smarter, not harder** as developers. He shares ways to choose productivity with a few stories in Ember.

* Test driven development: Choose a feedback loop designed for experimentation and learning
* Hot reloading: Choose a feedback loop designed with layout in mind
* User experience: Choose a feedback loop your customers will love 

Stay tuned for future announcements by following [@embercamp](https://twitter.com/embercamp) on Twitter. And **save the date**, EmberCamp Chicago 2019 will be on August 23rd.
