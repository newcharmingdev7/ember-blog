## [Yehuda's Octane tutorial continued 🔥](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)

Our very own [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats) wrote a blog series for an [Octane tutorial](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/), and there are two new posts added to it.

The third part of the tutorial, [Pulling Out Data](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/30/ember-octane-a-data-file/), talks about moving data from HTML into a separate file. This is the part in the series that introduces you to writing Javascript for the first time. You'll also learn how to build your helpers and write unit tests for them.

The fourth part of the tutorial, [Airtable Time](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/04/06/ember-octane-airtable-time/), talks about moving the JSON into Airtable. It is a great approach that will reduce the need for an application build for changing only data.

So far there are seven posts planned:

- [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)
- [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/)
- [Pulling Out Data](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/30/ember-octane-a-data-file/)
- [Airtable Time](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/04/06/ember-octane-airtable-time/)
- Cleaning Things Up
- Adding More Pages
- Polishing: Server-Side Rendering, Prerendering and Code Splitting

So be on the look out 👀 for more in this very helpful new series!

## [Contribute to the Global Accessibility Awareness Day blog series ✍️](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/issues/628)

The Ember Accessbility strike team is organizing a blog post series for [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/)! This May 21st will mark the ninth annual Global Accessibility Awareness Day. The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone **talking, thinking and learning** about digital (web, software, mobile, etc.) access/inclusion and people with different disabilities.

Interested in writing a post about an a11y topic such as screenreaders, WCAG, or the POUR model? Coordinate with the team on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/issues/628) and the [#st-a11y channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/680503382036840496) on the [Ember Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs).

## [Call for contributors: Shipping the Ember website(s) redesign 🎨🐹](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1254497875062673411)

Early last year the community came together to [discuss the future of the design strategy of official Ember sites](https://twitter.com/emberjs/status/1105157291806883840). After plenty of time and work investments from individual contributors, companies and the Ember Core team, the redesign for the [original RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0425-website-redesign.html) had [shipped successfully](https://twitter.com/emberjs/status/1230912205631213569) for the main site of the project: [emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com)!

But many other official resources within the Ember community are looking forward to get a new look & feel as well - and you can help with that! A [call for contributors](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1254497875062673411?s=21) is looking for those who have experience with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and who want to help shipping the website redesign to e.g. Ember's API Docs or the CLI Guides.

Want to get started? Be sure to read the [official status update for the Ember Website](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/04/26/update-ember-website.html) on the blog for more details on how to contribute. And feel free to reach out to the folks on the **#st-website** channel on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) for any questions. We're looking forward to your contributions!
