## [Ember tutorials on MDN 🎉](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks#Ember_tutorials)

[Preston Sego (@NullVoxPopuli)](https://github.com/nullvoxpopuli) shared the [news](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1262124413794881541) that [Ember tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks#Ember_tutorials) are now on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) web docs, along with React and Vue! It's awesome to see Ember included in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), one of the most respected resources on the web for frontend developers. 

In the [Ember tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks#Ember_tutorials), you'll build a **TodoMVC app in Ember**. You can verify your code with the [tutorial code repository](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-todomvc-tutorial/tree/master/steps/00-finished-todomvc/todomvc) and also check out a [live deployed version](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-todomvc-tutorial/). Thank you @NullVoxPopuli for your efforts in getting the word out about Ember! 👏

## ["My Experience with Ember.js" Part 2 🎬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2JdP4lb5Xw)

[Cal Woolgar (@calWoolgar)](https://github.com/calWoolgar) has a second video out, called [Creating an Ember Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2JdP4lb5Xw)! He demonstrates how Ember CLI makes it simple to get started with Ember.js.

This video touches on an [Ember app's anatomy](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/anatomy-of-an-ember-app/). With Ember CLI, you can create a fully working application with **one line of code!** 🎉

```bash
ember new "app-name"
```

With that command, Ember CLI installs all your dependencies for your new app. You can also create [routes](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/defining-your-routes/) and [templates](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/) with the CLI.

```bash
ember generate template "template-name"
ember generate route "route-name"
```

These are great videos for someone learning Ember, look forward to the next video from Cal! 😃
