As the basic object type in Ember, being able to test a simple
`Ember.Object` sets the foundation for testing more specific parts of your
Ember application such as controllers, components, etc. Testing an `Ember.Object`
is as simple as creating an instance of the object, setting it's state, and
running assertions against the object. By way of example lets look at a few
common cases.

### Testing Computed Properties

Let's start by looking at an object that has a `computedFoo` computed property
based on a `foo` property.

```javascript
App.SomeThing = Em.Object.extend({
  foo: 'bar',
  computedFoo: function(){
    return 'computed ' + this.get('foo');
  }.property('foo')
});
```

Within the test we'll create an instance, update the `foo` property (which
should trigger the computed property), and assert that the logic in our
computed property is working correctly.

```javascript
module('Unit: SomeThing');

test('computedFoo correctly concats foo', function() {
  var someThing = App.SomeThing.create();
  Ember.run(function(){
    someThing.set('foo', 'baz');
  });
  equal(someThing.get('computedFoo'), 'computed baz');
});
```

### Testing object Methods

Next lets look at testing logic found within an object's method. In this case
the `testMethod` method alters some internal state of the object (by updating
the `foo` property).

```javascript
App.SomeThing = Em.Object.extend({
  foo: 'bar',
  testMethod: function() {
    this.set('foo', 'baz');
  }
});
```

To test it we create an instance of `SomeThing`, call the `testMethod` method
and assert that the internal state is correct as a result of the method call.

```javascript
module('Unit: SomeThing');

test('calling testMethod updates foo', function() {
  var someThing = App.SomeThing.create();
  someThing.testMethod();
  equal(someThing.get('foo'), 'baz');
});
```

<script src="http://jsbin.com/holux/3"></script>

In the event the object's method returns a value you can simply assert that the
return value is calculated correctly. Suppose our object has a `calc` property
that returns a value based on some internal state.

```javascript
App.SomeThing = Em.Object.extend({
  count: 0,
  calc: function() {
    this.incrementProperty('count');
    return 'count: ' + this.get('count');
  }
});
```

The test would call the `calc` method and assert it gets back the correct value.

```javascript
module('Unit: SomeThing');

test('testMethod returns incremented count', function() {
  var someThing = App.SomeThing.create();
  equal(someThing.calc(), 'count: 1');
  equal(someThing.calc(), 'count: 2');
});
```

### Testing Observers

Suppose we have an object that has an observable method based on the `foo`
property.

```javascript
App.SomeThing = Em.Object.extend({
  foo: 'bar',
  other: 'no',
  doSomething: function(){
    this.set('other', 'yes');
  }.observes('foo')
});
```

In order to test the `doSomething` method we create an instance of `SomeThing`,
update the observed property (`foo`), and assert that the effects of the method
are working correctly.

```javascript
module('Unit: SomeThing');

test('doSomething observer sets other prop', function() {
  var someThing = App.SomeThing.create();
  someThing.set('foo', 'baz');
  equal(someThing.get('other'), 'yes');
});
```
