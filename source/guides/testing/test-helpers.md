One of the major issues in testing web applications is that all code is 
event-driven, therefore has the potential to be asynchronous (ie output can 
happen out of sequence from input). This has the ramification that code can be 
executed in any order.

An example may help here: Let's say a user clicks two buttons, one after another 
and both load data from different servers. They take different times to respond.

When writing your tests, you need to be keenly aware of the fact that you cannot 
be sure that the response will return immediately after you make your requests, 
therefore your assertion code (the "tester") needs to wait for the thing being 
tested (the "testee") to be in a synchronized state. In the example above, that 
would be when both servers have responded and the test code can go about its 
business checking the data (whether it is mock data, or real data).

This is why all Ember's test helpers are wrapped in code that ensures Ember is 
back in a synchronized state when it makes its assertions. It saves you from 
having to wrap everything in code that does that, and it makes it easier to read 
your tests because there's less boilerplate in them

Ember includes several helpers to facilitate integration testing. There are two 
types of helpers: **asynchronous** and **synchronous**.

### Asynchronous Helpers

Asynchronous helpers are "aware" of (and wait for) asynchronous behavior within 
your application, making it much easier to write deterministic tests.

* `visit(url)`
  - Visits the given route and returns a promise that fulfills when all resulting 
     async behavior is complete.
* `fillIn(input_selector, text)`
  - Fills in the selected input with the given text and returns a promise that 
     fulfills when all resulting async behavior is complete.
* `click(selector)`
  - Clicks an element and triggers any actions triggered by the element's `click` 
    event and returns a promise that fulfills when all resulting async behavior 
    is complete.
* `keyEvent(selector, type, keyCode)`
  - Simulates a key event type, e.g. `keypress`, `keydown`, `keyup` with the 
    desired keyCode on element found by the selector.
* `triggerEvent(selector, type, options)`
  - Triggers the given event, e.g. `blur`, `dblclick` on the element identified 
    by the provided selector.

### Synchronous Helpers

Synchronous helpers are performed immediately when triggered.

* `find(selector, context)`
  - Finds an element within the app's root element and within the context 
    (optional). Scoping to the root element is especially useful to avoid 
    conflicts with the test framework's reporter.
* `currentPath()`
  - Returns the current path.
* `currentRouteName()`
  - Returns the currently active route name.
* `currentURL()`
  - Returns the current URL.

### Wait Helpers

The `andThen` helper will wait for all preceding asynchronous helpers to 
complete prior to progressing forward. Let's take a look at the following 
example.

```javascript
test("simple test", function(){
  expect(1); // Ensure that we will perform one assertion

  visit("/posts/new");
  fillIn("input.title", "My new post");
  click("button.submit");

  // Wait for asynchronous helpers above to complete
  andThen(function() {
    equal(find("ul.posts li:last").text(), "My new post");
  });
});
```

Note that in the example above we are using the `andThen` helper. This will wait 
for the preceding asynchronous test helpers to complete and then calls the 
function which was passed to it as an argument.

### Custom Test Helpers

`Ember.Test.registerHelper` and `Ember.Test.registerAsyncHelper` are used to 
register test helpers that will be injected when `App.injectTestHelpers` is 
called. The difference between `Ember.Test.registerHelper` and 
`Ember.Test.registerAsyncHelper` is that the latter will not run until any 
previous async helper has completed and any subsequent async helper will wait 
for it to finish before running.

The helper method will always be called with the current Application as the 
first parameter. Helpers need to be registered prior to calling 
`App.injectTestHelpers()`.

Here is an example of a non-async helper:

```javascript
Ember.Test.registerHelper('shouldHaveElementWithCount', 
  function(app, selector, n, context) {
    var el = findWithAssert(selector, context);
    var count = el.length;
    equal(n, count, 'found ' + count + ' times');
  }
);

// shouldHaveElementWithCount("ul li", 3);
```

Here is an example of an async helper:

```javascript
Ember.Test.registerAsyncHelper('dblclick', 
  function(app, selector, context) {
    var $el = findWithAssert(selector, context);
    Ember.run(function() {
      $el.dblclick();
    });
  }
);

// dblclick("#person-1")
```

Async helpers also come in handy when you want to group interaction
into one helper. For example:

```javascript
Ember.Test.registerAsyncHelper('addContact',
  function(app, name, context) {
    fillIn('#name', name);
    click('button.create');
  }
);

// addContact("Bob");
// addContact("Dan");
```

#### Example

Here is an example of using both `registerHelper` and `registerAsyncHelper`.
