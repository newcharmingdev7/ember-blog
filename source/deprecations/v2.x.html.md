## Deprecations Added in Ember 2.x

What follows is a list of deprecations introduced to Ember.js during the 2.x
cycle.

For more information on deprecations in Ember, see the [main deprecations page]
(/deprecations).

### Deprecations Added in 2.1

#### Initializer Arity

In prior versions of Ember initializers have taken two arguments (generally labeled as
`container` and `application`). Starting with Ember 2.1 providing two arguments to an
`initializer` will trigger a deprecation.

The following initializer for Ember 2.0 will trigger a deprecation:

```javascript
export function initialize(container, application) {
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

To clear the deprecation, remove the first argument (`container` in the above example):

```javascript
export function initialize(application) {
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

In some cases an addon might need to support both versions of Ember with the same initializer,
one way to do this without triggering a deprecation would be the following (using the same
example as above):

```javascript
export function initialize() {
  let application = arguments[1] || arguments[0];
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

#### Ember.Application#registry / Ember.ApplicationInstance#registry

When the container and registry were split, the registry was added to `Ember.Application` instances (provided to
initializers as the first argument in 2.1) and `Ember.ApplicationInstance` instances (provided to instance initializers
as the first argument). Unfortunately, this was done without making it clear that the `.registry` property on
`Ember.Application` instances was private. This lead quite a few addons and applications to directly use the registry.

During the 2.1 cycle a new feature (`ember-registry-container-reform`) was enabled to provide more
public API's to access the `registry` functionality (without exposing all of the private internals).

The following list can be used to migrate from `app.registry.*` usage to the new public API's:

* `app.registry.resolve` -> `app.resolveRegistration`
* `app.registry.register` -> `app.register`
* `app.registry.unregister` -> `app.unregister`
* `app.registry.has` -> `app.hasRegistration`
* `app.registry.option` -> `app.registerOption`
* `app.registry.options` -> `app.registerOptions`
* `app.registry.getOptions` -> `app.registeredOptions`
* `app.registry.optionsForType` -> `app.registerOptionsForType`
* `app.registry.getOptionsForType` -> `app.registeredOptionsForType`
* `app.registry.injection` -> `app.inject`

#### Ember debug function options

Starting in Ember 2.1 various debug functions now require a third argument (commonly called `options`).

`id` is required by all methods listed below, and the deprecation related methods also require an `until` property.

* `Ember.deprecate`
* `Ember.deprecateFunc`
* `Ember.computed.deprecatingAlias`
* `Ember.warn`

The `id` property is intended to allow runtime debug handlers to uniquely identify the source, and the `until` property is used
to indicate the future version when the deprecated behavior will no longer exist.

The goal of these changes is to allow tools like
[ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) to make managing
these deprecations and warnings much easier (by matching on the `id` instead of the full deprecation/warn message).

#### Ember.Component#defaultLayout

Specifying a `defaultLayout` to a component is deprecated in favor of specifying `layout` directly. `defaultLayout` was
often used in order to allow inheriting components to fallback to their parents `defaultLayout` if a custom `layout` was
not provided. Due to the way a components layout is looked up naturally, this is true when using `layout` properties in
both locations. Changing the `layout` detection process allows initial render speed (with many components) to be
improved pretty significantly.

Before:

```javascript
// Ember < 2.1
import layout from '../templates/some-thing-lol';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  defaultLayout: layout
});
```

After:

```javascript
// Ember 2.1 and later
import layout from '../templates/some-thing-lol';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  layout: layout
});
```
