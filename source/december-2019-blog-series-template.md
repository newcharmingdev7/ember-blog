title: Create a blog post for December DD, 2019 about the `ADDON` addon
labels: decEmber, help wanted
assignees: ''

## Goal

Write a short blog post for the December blog series that is similar to the [example post]( https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/blob/be8f29ba0ae8b5367d1758b1a150c1b503812a77/source/2019-12-01-countdown-to-the-new-year-ember-sortable.md).

## Criteria

- [ ] file name should 2019-12-DD-countdown-to-the-new-year-ADDON-NAME.md where DD is replaced with the day and ADDON-NAME is replaced with the hyphenated name of the addon
- [ ] The opening sentence should be updated where COUNT is the sequential ordinal word. 

```markdown
**This is the COUNT in our DecEmber series- <span style="font-style: italic;">"Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons"</span>. We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day COUNT

To kick things off, we're going to look at [](). 

READMORE
```

- [ ] The first h2 should be "Day NUM" where NUM is the same as the DD in the date.
- [ ] the link to the addon should point to the page on Ember Observer
- [ ] There should be two sub sections: (both h3)- "What it does" and "Why I like it" 
- [ ] Include whether or not the addon has been updated yet for Ember Octane- if not, invite contributors to help get the addon Octane ready.
- [ ] The closing sentence can be slightly altered but should feel similar: 
"Do you use this addon? Or one like it? We'd love to hear about Ember addons that bring you joy!"
