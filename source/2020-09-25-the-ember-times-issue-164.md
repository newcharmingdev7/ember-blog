## [A new reference page for Ember CLI commands üîñ](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/cli-commands-reference/)

The Ember CLI Guides has a new webpage that lists [all Ember CLI commands](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/cli-commands-reference/). Please bookmark it for reference and onboarding new developers.

As you can imagine, the list of commands and command options grew over time so documenting it for the CLI Guides wasn't a trivial task. We'd like to recognize [Tim (@fozy81)](https://github.com/fozy81) for their amazing contribution. üíØ

As always, you can check commands and command options in your terminal by running `ember --help`. Please feel free to provide feedback for the new webpage. If you see incorrect or missing information, you can open an issue in the [cli-guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides) repo.

## [Migrating off of mixins in Ember Octane üëã](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/)

Greetings from Ember Times HQ! We had a **Readers' Question** come in: 

> What's the recommended alternative for `Ember.Mixin` in Octane?

In Classic Ember, if you wanted to define a piece of DOM behavior that you could reuse across your application, you would define a component `Mixin` that implemented the appropriate lifecycle hooks. As of Ember 3.15, the Ember project recommends Ember Octane for new applications and addons. And idiomatic Octane recommends that you avoid mixins. Going back to [Octane is Here](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html), [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)'s](https://github.com/wycats) gives a migration example. Element modifiers provide a new way to reuse DOM behavior, without some of the drawbacks that mixins have.

**Before (Classic Ember): Mixins**

```js
import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';

export default Mixin.create({
  didInsertElement() {
    this._super();
    activateTabs(this.element);
  }

  willDestroyElement() {
    this._super();
    deactivateTabs(this.element);
  }
})
```

And then you would use the `Mixin` in a component like this:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend(Tabs, {
  // ...
});
```

**After (Ember Octane): Element Modifiers**

This is what our `Tabs` mixin looks like when reimplemented as a modifier.

```js
import { modifier } from 'ember-modifier';

export default modifier(element => {
  activateTabs(element);

  return () => deactivateTabs(element);
});
```

Since element modifiers work on any element, you don't need to create a whole component to create reusable DOM behavior. You can use a modifier on any element with this element modifier syntax.

```hbs
<div {{tabs}}></div>
```

Continuing further on mixins, [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) recently blogged about [Migrating Off of PromiseProxyMixin in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/). A common pattern in many Classic Ember apps and addons was to use `PromiseProxyObject` mixin with `ObjectProxy` to expose the state of a promise to end users, and to make accessing the resolved data more convenient. Be sure to read the [blog post](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/) for a deeper dive into a few suggested ways to rewrite code into a lightweight, auto-tracke and Octane-ready solution. 

P.S. Looking to future-proof no mixins in your codebase? We suggest enabling the [no-mixins rule on eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-mixins.md).

## [Blog Post: Async Data and Autotracking in Ember Octane ‚ú®](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/async-data-and-autotracking-in-ember-octane/)

A new blog post from [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) talks about [Async Data and Autotracking in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/async-data-and-autotracking-in-ember-octane/). This blog post is a continuation of our previous writeup on [Migrating Off of PromiseProxyMixin in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/), which describes a way to divest mixin and inheritance in favor of composition. Chris does this by using a [load helper](https://gist.github.com/chriskrycho/306a82990dd82203073272e055df5cd1) and a new `AsyncData` structure.

The new blog goes through treating that `AsyncData` as ordinary data, but making sure to handle all states (loading, loaded, error). By integrating with tracked properties, the `AsyncData` class reacts to its modeled states and internals, handling this transition for us. This enables us to access the data returned from the load helper as normal data and react based on its state.

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { load } from 'my-app/helpers/load';
import { fetchSomeData } from 'my-app/data/fetchers';

export default class Neato extends Component {
  get data() {
    return load(fetchSomeData(this.args.userId));
  }

  get displayData() {
    switch (this.data.state) {
      case 'LOADING':
        return 'loading...';
      case 'LOADED':
        return this.data.value;
      case 'ERROR':
        return `Whoops! Something went wrong! ${this.data.error.message}`;
    }
  }
}
```

## [Autotracking Developer Experience üî•](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/autotracking-elegant-dx-via-cutting-edge-cs/)

If you couldn't get enough [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho), we have good news! üòÑ  Chris has released a follow-up blog post to the one referenced above. 

How does autotracking in Ember or Glimmer work? How does it improve developer experience? Which computer science concepts make it possible? (Answer: Lamport clocks ü§Ø)

If you're ready to learn a bit more about how efficient the autotracking system in Ember or Glimmer apps can be, you should head on over to the [post](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/autotracking-elegant-dx-via-cutting-edge-cs/). 

Rest assured, it's a pretty approachable explanation of some complex topics that we as Ember users benefit from in an Octane world. All are encouraged to go check it out!

## [ember-concurrency 2.0.0.beta-1 üéâ](https://twitter.com/m4xm4n/status/1308945677800681473)

There's a [new beta release](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1) of `ember-concurrency`! Thanks to the hard work of [Max Fierke (@maxfierke)](https://github.com/maxfierke) 2.0.0.beta-1 introduces `@tracked` on Ember 3.16+, removes the ability to directly use the `{{action}}` helper, and removes the `get` and `set` compatibility methods from `Task`, `TaskGroup`, and `TaskInstance`.

As Max mentions in his tweet, 2.x is largely compatible with 1.x. For users that maintain addons that depend on `ember-concurrency`, it would be very helpful if you can use a wider version range so that some folks can try the 2.x betas and others can upgrade when they're able to. 

More information about this and about upgrading to 2.0.0-beta.1 and other future 2.x releases in
general can be found in the [upgrade document](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/blob/v2/UPGRADING-2.x.md).

Go ahead and give the [release](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1) notes a read.

## [EmberJS with REST API üí™](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/)

[John Costanzo (@jrock2004)](https://twitter.com/jrock2004) wrote a blog titled [EmberJS with REST API](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/). The blog explains how to get your APIs to work well with Ember Data out of the box, if it follows REST API conventions. If your APIs don't follow REST conventions, the post gives details about how to modify your Ember app serializer to make it work with Ember Data. 

The blog also discusses using [`keyForAttribute`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/JSONAPISerializer/methods/keyForAttribute?anchor=keyForAttribute) to make some of the manual work a little easier, so that you do not have to map each API property to the Ember model property. Head over to [the blog post](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/) today and give it a read.
