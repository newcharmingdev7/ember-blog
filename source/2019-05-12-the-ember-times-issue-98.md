## [`model` Hook, Illuminated in Ember.js Guides 💡](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)

If you haven't yet, please revisit and share the latest Ember.js Guides on [Specifying a Route's Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)! You will find **beginner-friendly, comprehensive explanation** of what you can do in a route's `model` hook. 💖

In particular, our guide now shows:

- Why we want to use the `model` hook
- How to use `model`, depending on your use case and knowledge of Ember
- How to use **dynamic segments** in `model`
- How to debug `model`

These updates are stepping stones to [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber)'s [major initiative to help developers learn Ember Data easily](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/20). Please thank @jenweber for her positive work, as well as [@acorncom](https://github.com/acorncom), [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang), [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north), and [@zachgarwood](https://github.com/zachgarwood) for their help with reviews!
