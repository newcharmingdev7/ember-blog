## [`model` Hook, Illuminated in Ember.js Guides 💡](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)

If you haven't yet, please revisit and share the latest Ember.js Guides on [Specifying a Route's Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)! You will find **beginner-friendly, comprehensive explanation** of what you can do in a route's `model` hook. 💖

In particular, our guide now shows:

- Why we want to use the `model` hook
- How to use `model`, depending on your use case and knowledge of Ember
- How to use **dynamic segments** in `model`
- How to debug `model`

These updates are stepping stones to [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber)'s [major initiative to help developers learn Ember Data easily](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/20). Please thank Jen for her positive work, as well as [@acorncom](https://github.com/acorncom), [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang), [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north), and [@zachgarwood](https://github.com/zachgarwood) for their help with reviews!

## [Use Empress to render the Ember RFCs 📃](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/489)
<!--alex ignore king-queen-->
[@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) proposed an implementation change to how we currently "render" our RFCs in the [website](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/). The proposed change is to move from using `mdbook`, which provides better formatting for markdown files, to employing [Empress](https://github.com/empress) techniques to render the RFC pages.

In the same proposal, the official URL of an RFC was proposed to move from `https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0425-website-redesign.html` to `https://rfcs.emberjs.com/0425-website-redesign/`. This would then be considered a stable URL and will require us to maintain redirects if we ever change them.

Read and comment more on [GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/489) about the proposed change!

## [EmberWork.com ✌️](https://emberwork.com/)
  
We often hear folks say they want to work in Ember, but they can't find an Ember role! There's a new community resource for that—[Ember Work](https://emberwork.com/). Ember Work was built to make things **a little easier** on you. No more scouring LinkedIn or other sources. And no more jobs that are not *quite* Ember. 

Have an open role on your team? Share it on [Ember Work](https://emberwork.com/) for free. (While you're at it, post it on [#ember-jobs](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480523148102467623) on Discord too!) Thanks [@herzzanu](https://github.com/herzzanu) and [@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) for building this resource for the community. 💼

## [FAQs about Ember.js in 2019 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️](https://medium.com/ember-ish/faqs-about-ember-js-in-2019-64efabbf84e6)

As developers who have worked with Ember for years, we can sometimes forget that we had once approached Ember with a bit of curiosity 😋, a bit of caution 😧, and a bit of confusion 🤕. As Ember approaches its 8th birthday, we want to continue to reach out to the wider JavaScript community, welcome new developers, and help out with their questions.

This week, [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) took her time to [engage a wide audience on Medium](https://medium.com/ember-ish/faqs-about-ember-js-in-2019-64efabbf84e6) and answer commonly asked questions about Ember. *What companies use Ember? What is Octane? How can I get started with learning Ember?*

We encourage you to [read and share the blog post](https://medium.com/ember-ish/faqs-about-ember-js-in-2019-64efabbf84e6)! If you have time, we encourage you to pen and share your Ember article as well. 🙏
