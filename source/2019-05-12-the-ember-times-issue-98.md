## [`model` Hook, Illuminated in Ember.js Guides 💡](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)

If you haven't yet, please revisit and share the latest Ember.js Guides on [Specifying a Route's Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)! You will find **beginner-friendly, comprehensive explanation** of what you can do in a route's `model` hook. 💖

In particular, our guide now shows:

- Why we want to use the `model` hook
- How to use `model`, depending on your use case and knowledge of Ember
- How to use **dynamic segments** in `model`
- How to debug `model`

These updates are stepping stones to [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber)'s [major initiative to help developers learn Ember Data easily](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/20). Please thank Jen for her positive work, as well as [@acorncom](https://github.com/acorncom), [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang), [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north), and [@zachgarwood](https://github.com/zachgarwood) for their help with reviews!

## [Jabber away about Javascript 📻](https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1128351412881063937)
A new podcast episode of [Javascript Jabber](https://twitter.com/JSJabber) has been released in which [Sam Selikoff](https://twitter.com/samselikoff) is interviewed by [AJ ONeal](https://twitter.com/solderjs) about **Ember** 🐹. They go into detail regarding how Sam got started working with Ember and a little bit about the **history of the Ember framework**.

From the [shownotes](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-364-ember-octane-with-sam-selikoff/):
"Sam mentions some of the biggest advantages in using Ember, and what it should and should not be used for. He explains the architecture of Ember apps, addresses some of the performance concerns and then dives into Octane in detail."

So make sure to check it out and [give it a listen 🎧](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-364-ember-octane-with-sam-selikoff/)! You can tell us, and Sam, what you thought on the [#media channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/486955806588403773/) on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS).

## [EmberWork.com ✌️](https://emberwork.com/)
  
We often hear folks say they want to work in Ember, but they can't find an Ember role! There's a new community resource for that—[Ember Work](https://emberwork.com/). Ember Work was built to make things **a little easier** on you. No more scouring LinkedIn or other sources. And no more jobs that are not *quite* Ember. 

Have an open role on your team? Share it on [Ember Work](https://emberwork.com/) for free. (While you're at it, post it on [#ember-jobs](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480523148102467623) on Discord too!) Thanks [@herzzanu](https://github.com/herzzanu) and [@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) for building this resource for the community. 💼
