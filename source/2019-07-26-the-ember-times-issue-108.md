## [How to Hire and Train Developers when You Don’t Use React 📚](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/how-to-hire-and-train-developers-when-you-dont-use-react-42762e6b1a57)
  
[@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) wrote an awesome blogpost on how to hire and train new developers.
In 10 steps she points out the pain points of every new hire and how to solve them as a company.
If you are in charge of hiring new people or if you have a new colleague in your team, this is definitively a nice piece to get some new ideas about your onboarding process.
When you are the lucky one to have started a new job, this post is a nice read to realize that you are not the only one with start-up problems and it might help you formulate what you are missing right now.

## [Sentry Error Reporting for Ember.js 📈](https://simplabs.com/blog/2019/07/15/sentry-and-ember/)

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/ember/) is an open-source error tracking tool that helps you monitor and fix production errors in your Ember app. In 2018, Sentry announced a new SDK for browsers, called `@sentry/browser`.

To help you get started, [@Turbo87](https://github.com/Turbo87) published a blog post. 🧡 In particular, you can learn how to:

- migrate from `ember-cli-sentry` addon to the official `@sentry/browser`
- report messages and exceptions to Sentry at will
- filter out errors that aren't critical
- add metadata to errors

We encourage you to [deliver high-quality Ember apps today](https://simplabs.com/blog/2019/07/15/sentry-and-ember/)!
