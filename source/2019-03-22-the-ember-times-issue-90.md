## [Greetings from EmberConf 2019](https://emberconf.com)

This week [EmberConf - the biggest, annual Ember conference](https://emberconf.com) - took place in Portland, Oregon, United States. Ember developers from all around the world came together to learn more about the newest features of the framework, best practices, case studies and most importantly meet online Ember friends.

This year's [keynote by Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz](https://youtu.be/O3RKLHvpUAI?t=369) featured lots of insight into the **present and future of Ember** and the official announcement for the [**Edition Preview** of **Ember Octane**](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/).
