## ["I contribute to Ember" with Ben Demboski 👨‍💻](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-ben-demboski/17294)

</div>

In our **fourteenth edition** of our contributor interview series, community member [Ben Demboski @bendemboski](https://github.com/bendemboski) talks about his work on [ember-electron](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-electron).

We’d like to thank Ben for his contributions to the Ember community, and for all of his help keeping ember-electron up and running!

Check out the full interview on [the Ember Discuss forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-ben-demboski/17294).

<p style="font-style: italic;">The idea behind these interviews is to provide community members with more information and insight into open source contributions, learning resources and community events. Contributors to the community gain a platform to share their thoughts on their own experiences and learnings as they were contributing to Ember. Our hope is that it gives first-time and advancing contributors a better sense of the fact that everyone starts out small, and that anyone can have a big impact on the community.</p>
