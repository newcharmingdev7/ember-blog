## [RFC for an alternative to Controllers 🥴](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/499)
[@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) proposed **two** RFCs to outline how we can eventually remove controllers from Ember.
 - [RFC 499](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/499) Proposes an alternative way of rendering templates for a particular route. (if some of you remember routable components, this isn't that 😉)
 - [RFC 380](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/380) Proposas a service for handling query parameters, as well as a `@queryParam` **decorator** for accessing query parameters anywhere in your app: Routes, Components, etc. 🎉
 
With these two RFCs, we'll eventually be able to deprecate Controllers. 🔥🔥🔥
