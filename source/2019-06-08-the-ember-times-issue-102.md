## [More #EmberJS2019 Posts Wanted! ✏️](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)

Don't forget. **June 17** is the deadline for your #EmberJS2019 post to be a part of Roadmap RFC! Please write a blog post, GitHub Gist, or tweet, then share it with **roadmap@emberjs.com** and Discord community. 🧡

<a class="ember-button ember-button--centered" href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html">Read the Roadmap RFC</a>

For ideas and inspiration, you can check out the #EmberJS2019 posts at our [community repo](https://github.com/abhilashlr/emberjs2019-posts). If time's not on your side, feel free to write and share your post even after the deadline.

Here are the highlights from this week's posts:

---

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/Turbo87) focused on Ember being able to [support existing technologies](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1135790015177469952):

> @yarnpkg PnP is a fantastic way to reclaim some/a lot of disk space. I started some work last year to support it in Ember CLI, but couldn't finish it in time. We should revisit this!

---

[@efx](https://github.com/efx) shared [thoughts on existing posts](https://www.typedspace.com/2019-ember-js-roadmap/).

> I think we should treat learning as important as the technical ideas that distinguish ember.js. [...] My fabulous colleagues have often asked spot-on, difficult questions about the guide's admonitions to do something a particular way. I too often resort to shallow "that is just the way it is" answers.


[@dgeb](https://github.com/dgeb) suggests to [focus on modularity and packaging, both at the framework and application levels](https://www.cerebris.com/blog/2019/06/04/emberjs-2019/).

> [With Ember Octane] it's time for us to focus on how we structure and bind and package those modules, both at the framework and application levels.

---

[@jacojoubert](https://github.com/jacojoubert) shared [four things Ember can improve for even better developer experience](https://gist.github.com/jacojoubert/abfb45bdc8c4a2a5efdab3b37ed0d060).

> Ember needs a way for a component to have direct knowledge of its children, [...] clearer about where they want to end up with the file system layout, [...] spread `...attributes` on multiple elements, [...] and public API and get a full suite of documentation (for AST transforms).

---

[@lifeart](https://github.com/lifeart) asks for a visible roadmap where features being worked on can be moved around ["backlog" or "need discussion" lists](https://gist.github.com/lifeart/71c4aa33fc85874d3cc9cdedd2a22684).

> I see a lot of work around but it's not written in roadmap anywhere. [...] it will be great to have kinda "likes" for non important features, to prioritize them.

---

## [RFC for an alternative to Controllers 🥴](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/499)
[@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) proposed **two** RFCs to outline how we can eventually remove controllers from Ember.
 - [RFC 499](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/499) proposes an alternative way of rendering templates for a particular route. (if some of you remember routable components, this isn't that 😉)
 - [RFC 380](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/380) proposes adding a `queryParams` property to the `RouterService` for accessing query parameters anywhere in your app: Routes, Components, etc. 🎉
 
With these two RFCs, we're heading in the right direction for eventually being able to deprecate Controllers. 🔥🔥🔥 Read, comment, and spread the word! 🖊️
