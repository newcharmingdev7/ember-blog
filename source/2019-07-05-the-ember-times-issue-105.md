## [To Sync or Not to Sync: Observers 2.0 ⏱](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0494-async-observers.html)

In an effort to remove legacy code from Ember, promote better programming practices in apps and lay the foundation for clearer code paths, a [recently accepted RFC (Request for Comments)](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/494) proposes an important change to the **observer** APIs: the [`addObserver`](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.10/functions/@ember%2Fobject%2Fobservers/addObserver), [`removeObserver`](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.10/functions/@ember%2Fobject%2Fobservers/removeObserver) and the [`observer`](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.10/functions/@ember%2Fobject/observer) functions shall be configurable to operate either synchronously (the way observers always used to work in Ember apps since the pre-v1.0 days) or asynchronously.

The RFC highlights how an option to set defaults for either the sync or async mode of observer operation in an app would help developers to re-configure their observers incrementally. Finally, the proposal argues that - in the long run - a deprecation of the synchronous observer behaviour should follow after the community had sufficient time to migrate away.

Find out more about the how and why behind **async observers** by giving the [full proposal a read!](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0494-async-observers.html)
