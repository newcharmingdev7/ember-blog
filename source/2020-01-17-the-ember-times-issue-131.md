## [4 RFCs on improving Ember's autotracking and reactivity system 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/use-and-resources/text/0567-use-and-resources.md#introducing-use-and-resources)

Ember Octane features a **new reactivity system**. In particular, **tracked properties** simplify syncing the DOM with JavaScript changes. (Find out how autotracking works from the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/autotracking-in-depth/).)

To help address some shortcomings, [Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq) proposed introducing the decorators and classes listed below. We encourage you to participate in RFCs and provide feedback today!

### [566. `@memo` decorator](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/566)

Unlike computed properties, autotracked getters don't cache their values. `@memo` will let you opt in to memoization.

### [567. `@use` decorator](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/567)

The `@use` API will leverage autotracking to solve two core issues:

- Allow Glimmer components to define a behavior with its own lifecycle, independently of the template
- Provide a standard way to mix declarative and imperative code

### [569. `TrackedList` class](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/569)

`TrackedList` will autotrack changes to arrays. This class, designed to replace `EmberArray`, will follow the native array API closely and be performant.

### [577. `TrackedMap` and `TrackedSet` classes](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/577)

`TrackedMap` and `TrackedSet`, along with their weak analogs, will autotrack changes to maps and sets (dynamic collections of values). These classes will follow the native APIs exactly.

## [New Test Waiters RFC ⏳](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/581)

<!--alex ignore waiters-waitresses-->
[Steve Calvert (@scalvert)](https://github.com/scalvert) proposed replacing the existing test waiters with the [ember-test-waiters](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-test-waiters) in the [New Test Waiters RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/581).


<!--alex ignore waiter-waitress-->
The new test waiter system will provide a few benefits:

<!--alex ignore waiter-waitress waiters-waitresses-->
- A **new API that removes the existing foot guns** given we will be more explicit when declaring the start and end of the waiter through the waiter `beginAsync` and `endAsync` methods
- A more robust way to gather **debugging information** for the test waiter since the waiter is identifiable by the name provided
- Default test waiters with the **ability to author your own, more complex test waiters** through annotating the asynchronous operations in your code base that are not tracked by an `await settled()` check

## [Optimizing your app with Ember Data 📈](https://runspired.com/2019/12/15/optimizing-your-app-with-ember-data/)

[Chris Thoburn (@runspired)](https://github.com/runspired) is blogging about how to build and optimize an app with Ember Data. You'll start by building an app, Listicle. Listicle starts as a small app shell with rich content lists, but balloons in size over time. Build times slow to a crawl as a result. 

At the beginning of the series, Listicle builds and renders in greater than 5 seconds. But as the posts progress, you'll end with an app with builds and renders in **less than 1 second** by optimizing only the app's data management! Then for fun, you'll optimize the render. 

You can check out [Part 1](https://runspired.com/2019/12/15/optimizing-your-app-with-ember-data/) and [Part 2](https://runspired.com/2019/12/18/optimizing-your-app-with-ember-data-part-2/) now, with more posts to come! And you can follow along with the code for the series by watching the [Listicle repository](https://github.com/runspired/listicle).

For some Ember Data context, check out the [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/). You can learn about the architecture and history in Chris's EmberFest [Ember Data 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqbsOyLM30&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkT0e094BZhGkUnf2WBF09xx&index=23&t=0s) conference talk.
