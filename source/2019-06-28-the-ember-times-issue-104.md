## [Live Embroider Demo by Edward Faulkner 🖥️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R1vS7_sLTM)

You might be wondering next, how do I start using [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider) in my app? How exactly do Embroider options affect my build? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️

At EmberATX, [Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4) showed how you can build the familiar [Super Rentals app](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-cli/) using Embroider. He also taught important [core and compatibility options](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider#options) and explained how they affect the first two build stages.

We encourage you to [learn more about Embroider today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R1vS7_sLTM)! If you are short on time, feel free to watch these highlights:

## [Quest: Prettier Glimmer 🎀✨](https://github.com/jgwhite/prettier/issues/1)

[@jgwhite](https://github.com/jgwhite) started a [quest issue](https://github.com/jgwhite/prettier/issues/1) to track the outstanding work required to have full [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) support for Ember templates. 

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures that all [outputted code conforms to a consistent style](https://jlongster.com/A-Prettier-Formatter) in order to avoid [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding) about styling rules or nit picks. It does this by parsing your code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and reprinting it from scratch disregarding all original styling. Today, Prettier already works for JavaScript including [ES2017](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) so this work revolves around supporting Ember templates.

Check out what parts you can contribute in the [quest issue](https://github.com/jgwhite/prettier/issues/1) on GitHub!
