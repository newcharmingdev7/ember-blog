### What It Does

Ember Power Select provides a powerful select component, built from the ground up for Ember so that it works the way you expect something to in Ember. Exceptionally [well documented](https://ember-power-select.com/docs), Ember Power Select outputs everything from a straightforward list of text items to an asynchronous search driven select which incorporates graphical elements in the list. The addon's website includes a (cookbook)[https://ember-power-select.com/cookbook] for more unusual requirements as well as a (list of community provided addons)[https://ember-power-select.com/addons] which address functionality outside of the scope of Ember Power Select.

### Why I Like It

I have grown to love using Ember Power Select which developing a crud-rich web app which benefits from many instances of select elements driven by asynchronous searches. I have made use of the provided descriptions to debounce those searches and so reduce the load on the server while maintining a slick feel to the interface. The behaviour of the selects is good just as they but the (clearly documented API)[https://ember-power-select.com/docs/api-reference] has allowed me to tweak each use of the addon and so provide better guidance to the users.

Although (some work)[https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-select/issues/1251] has been done to support Octane it appears that as of today this isn't yet complete.
