If you are a VS Code fan you may want to check out the latest releases of **two great** VS Code plugins by [Alex Kanunnikov @lifeart](https://github.com/lifeart) that provide support for Octane features in VS Code! ✨

The [Unstable Ember Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable) plugin now provides support for autocompletion of component arguments in templates, `LinkTo` route argument autocompletion and improved scope autocompletion.

And, the recently released [Glimmer Templates Syntax for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-glimmer-syntax) plugin provides support for formatting of Glimmer template files!
