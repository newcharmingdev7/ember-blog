## [Ember Data Repackaged in 3.11 📦](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0395-ember-data-packages.html)

Starting with Ember 3.11, Ember Data will be shipped as a **collection of small packages** under the namespace `@ember-data`. This helps you import only the packages that you need, identify the API that you can replace, and know where to start if you want to contribute to Ember Data. 🎉

Say hello to the new import syntax:

```
import Model, { attr, belongsTo, hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
```

Previous styles of import will be deprecated in a future release. Don't worry. Before that happens, a codemod and lint rules will be available to help you migrate your code.

We encourage you to learn today about [Ember Data packages in 3.11](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0395-ember-data-packages.html) and the exciting plan to [use Embroider to tree-shake Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/6166).

## [Tutorial: Ember Octane Fundamentals 🐹](https://twitter.com/michaellnorth/status/1148631049141751813)

[@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) published a [new training video series on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ember-octane/) on Ember Octane Fundamentals. If you are not a subscriber to Frontend Masters or prefer written instructions, there are [detailed written instructions hosted in GitHub](https://github.com/mike-north/ember-octane-workshop/tree/master/notes)!

Starting with regular HTML and CSS and going through hands-on experience working with glimmer components, tracked properties, actions, and modifiers – the Ember Octane Fundamentals training provides detailed steps in creating your own server-rendered chat application.

What’s even better is that since this is licensed under the BSD-2-Clause, you can feel free to use this material to conduct workshops in your own groups! Just make sure to give some feedback to [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north)!

## [Updates To Ember Igniter Articles 🔥](https://emberigniter.com/articles/)

[@frank06](https://github.com/frank06) has recently been updating his **awesome series of articles** regarding a variety of Ember.js subjects on his blog, **Ember Igniter**.

Many of the updates are aimed at brining the articles inline with newer versions of Ember.js. The articles are now applicable to Ember 3, and in many cases they even apply to Ember Octane!

If you haven't had a chance to checkout Ember Igniter before, be sure to checkout all the articles [here](https://emberigniter.com/articles/).
