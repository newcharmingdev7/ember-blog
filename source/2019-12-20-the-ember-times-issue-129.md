## [Octane is Here üéâ](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html)

Ember [3.15](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/ember-3-15-released.html) was released this week. In addition to the usual new features, improvements and bug fixes, this release also marks the official release of the Octane edition!

## [New ember-autofocus-modifier üí°](https://medium.com/qonto-engineering/autofocus-modifier-improving-our-component-apis-fd589b98f4e)

While building an autofocus feature for their components, Qonto engineers were also able to improve their APIs. [Cyrille David (@dcyriller)](https://github.com/dcyriller) and team wanted to add autofocus to several components across two apps. For example, both their one-time-password input and their email input component needed autofocus. Since mixins are no longer recommended in the Ember ecosystem, Cyrille went with modifiers. [And they blogged about their experience here!](https://medium.com/qonto-engineering/autofocus-modifier-improving-our-component-apis-fd589b98f4e)

Modifiers are a new feature in the upcoming Ember Octane edition for **sharing code between components**, similar to directives in Vue or Angular. We revisited [Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq)'s blog [Coming Soon in Ember Octane - Part 4: Modifiers](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/03/06/coming-soon-in-ember-octane-part-4.html) and the [Octane Guides preview docs: Out-of-Component-Modifications](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/components/template-lifecycle-dom-and-modifiers/#toc_out-of-component-modifications) to learn more!

Qonto wrapped up the code in a small addon, [`ember-autofocus-modifier`](https://github.com/qonto/ember-autofocus-modifier). You can use the code as-is, or copy the [snippet code](https://github.com/qonto/ember-autofocus-modifier/blob/v0.0.1/addon/modifiers/autofocus.js) and experiment with creating your own modifier.

## [3 New RFCs To Add New Template Helpers 3Ô∏è‚É£](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Acibernox+templates)

[Miguel Camba @cibernox](https://github.com/cibernox) opened a slew of RFCs around adding new built-in operators to Ember templates. The idea comes from functionality provided in [ember-truth-helpers](https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers) and is a subset of his [other RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/388) to add basic helpers to Ember templates.

The three template helper RFCs Miguel proposed are the following:

- [Adding Equality Operators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/560) such as the `{{eq}}` and `{{neq}}` helpers
- [Adding Numeric Comparison Operators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/561), specifically the `{{lt}}` and `{{gt}}` helpers
- [Adding Logical Operators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/562) which are the `{{and}}`, `{{or}}` and `{{not}}` helpers

Help get this off the ground by adding your input to these changes today!
