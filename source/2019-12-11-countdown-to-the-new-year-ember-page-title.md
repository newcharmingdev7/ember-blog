**This is the eleventh in our DecEmber series- "Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons". We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day 11

This addon [ember-page-title](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-page-title) provides a helper for changing the browser tab title of the page you're on within your Ember single-page application (SAP).

### What It Does

The `ember-page-title` addon provides a zero-config way to use npm packages in your Ember app, and even lazy-load them.

### Why I Like It

Thanks to `ember-page-title`, you can now easily provide users with a simple HTML browser title tag so they know where they are within your single-page application.

This addon is Octane-ready! <check to make sure it is>

Do you use this addon? Or one like it? We'd love to hear about Ember addons that bring you joy!
