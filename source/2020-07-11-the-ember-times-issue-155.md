## [Release of EmberJS 3.19! 🎉](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/06/26/ember-3-19-released.html)

The Ember project is releasing version 3.19 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. This release kicks off the 3.20 beta cycle for all sub-projects. There are no new features or deprecations [introduced in Ember 3.19](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/06/26/ember-3-19-released.html).

As a refresher the [Ember Release Cycle](https://blog.emberjs.com/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html) follows the following:

- Every six weeks: A new stable version of Ember.js
- Every week: A new beta of the next version of Ember.js
- Every day: A new canary build, which is the last successful build of the day
- Every successful build: The ember-latest.js build is updated

To help test beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time use the [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon to continuously test your projects against the latest releases.

## [Rock & Roll with Ember.js Octane edition is here 🔥🐹](https://twitter.com/baaz/status/1276104785079472130)

There's an updated version of [Balint Erdi's (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi) excellent book Rock & Roll with Ember.js available, now with coverage for Ember's Octane Edition! 🎉

If you have not had a chance to give Rock & Roll with Ember.js a read, you should. This is one of the most well-written books on Ember.js. It's a great way to introduce people who are new to Ember to the framework's conventions. 

Using a pragmatic approach of learn-by-building, Rock & Roll with Ember.js takes you through the process of building an Ember application from the ground up. You can expect to finish the book with a solid understanding of the fundamentals involved in building Ember applications.

You can find the book [here](https://www.balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/).

## [State of Frontend Survey 📊](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/)

Interested in helping Ember.js 🔥 get the recognition it deserves among other frontend tools? You may want to participate in the [State of Frontend Survey](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/).

<!--alex ignore easy of-course-->
This survey aims to assess frontend developers' work. It gives us a chance to provide input on tooling that we use (Ember, of course!). 

It also allows participants the opportunity to comment on tooling they would like to learn and provide thoughts about the future of frontend development trends.

The survey should only take 7 minutes or so of your time. Please help promote the visibility of Ember.js. Your participation can better ensure that the survey provides accurate information about what tools developers use.

Take a moment and fill out the survey [here](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/).

## [ember-meta 1.0.0 release 🚢](https://twitter.com/shipshapecode/status/1281406393577283587)

`ember-meta 1.0.0` has been released by [Ship Shape (@shipshapecode)](https://github.com/shipshapecode)! Thanks to [Chris Manson (@mansona)](https://github.com/mansona) for his continued help with this addon 🎉!

In case you weren't aware, `ember-meta` is an addon that helps set up `<meta>` tags for your Prember/Ember blog. These tags can support Open Graph, microdata, Twitter, Slack, etc.

This release updates dependencies, uses native class for the underlying service, and allows overloading some configurations.

Head on over to the [release notes](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-meta/releases/tag/v1.0.0) if you want to learn more.
