## [Release of ember-component-template-colocation-migrator 1.1.0 üéâ](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

The [ember-component-template-colocation-migrator](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator) codemod co-locates component JS and HBS files as described in the [Component Templates Co-location RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0481-component-templates-co-location.html). The v1.1.0 release adds [support for migrating addons](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator/pull/14), but templates shared by multiple components are excluded. In this case, it is up to end users how to list those; they are reported in the same way other skipped templates (like partials) are. Similarly, mixins that use layout are not migrated.

When running the codemod, instead of:


```sh
your-addon/
  addon/
    components/
      some-component.js
    templates/
      components/
        some-component.hbs
```

You will get:

```sh
your-addon/
  addon/
    components/
      some-component.js
      some-component.hbs
```

Try it out today by running the migrator in your app or addon:

```bash
npx github:ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator
```

## [Built with Ember.js: 10001 virtual art exhibit üé®](https://10001.undercurrent.nyc/exhibit/teams)

[Moacir P. de S√° Pereira (@muziejus)](http://github.com/muziejus) announced in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/muziejus/status/1291818497895477248) that while on vacation üèù, he's been helping an art gallery put together a website for a virtual exhibition: [10001.undercurrent.nyc](https://10001.undercurrent.nyc/).

> On August 5, [Undercurrent](https://undercurrent.nyc/) launched ‚Äú10001,‚Äù a collaborative virtual project that continues through September 12. This project is co-organized by the [European Union National Institutes of Culture](https://eunicglobal.eu/)‚Äôs New York Cluster. Borrowing the zip code from both the Empire State Building and New York City‚Äôs Central Post Office, ‚Äú10001‚Äù focuses on the collaboration of strangers and the narrative of their collective creative process using New York City as the linchpin. Coming from a variety of disciplines, twelve European Union artists who have never met each other will be randomly paired, making up a total of six teams. Through a series of Zoom sessions, each team will spend a six-week period developing a single project that will reimagine NYC post March 20, 2020.

The 10001 website is built with Ember 3.18! It's fantastic to see Ember.js being used **in the wild**, and we think that the site design is pretty rad too. Look forward to checking out the content as the artists continue their work on this pandemic-friendly exhibition.

## [ember-mobile-menu v2 released üì±](https://nickschot.github.io/ember-mobile-menu/)

Earlier in August, [Nick Schot (@nickschot)](https://github.com/nickschot) [announced the v2 release](https://twitter.com/nickschot/status/1290009657373626368) of `ember-mobile-menu`.

<!-- alex ignore retext-equality -->
In case you weren't aware, [`ember-mobile-menu`](https://github.com/nickschot/ember-mobile-menu) provides a gesture-enabled hamburger menu. You can check out a real-world implementation in [Empress Hummingbird](https://empress-hummingbird.netlify.app/).

For a complete list of new features in v2, we encourage you to check out Nick's [tweet](https://twitter.com/nickschot/status/1290009657373626368) and the [repo changelog](https://github.com/nickschot/ember-mobile-menu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200-2020-08-01). Here are a few of the best:

- Written in Octane (v3.20 at the time of writing)
- Spring physics and cancellable/resumable finishing animations
- Various menu styles
- FastBoot support

## [Help with Embroider Readiness üî•](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19099)

This week, [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats) opened a [meta issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19099) concerning the readiness of [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider), Ember's next build system. The issue is meant to track the steps that must be taken before people can practically use Ember with Embroider as a supported option with route-based code splitting ("Embroider readiness").

An app that enables Embroider's route-based code splitting with `splitAtRoutes` mode must be able to operate in the presence of the following flags (which means the app is not using classic dynamic features):

- staticAddonTestSupportTrees
- staticAddonTrees
- staticHelpers
- staticComponents

The first target for Emroider readiness is to create a transition path to route-based code splitting, which means that all addons included in the default blueprint must be able to do so. It also means that addons that are frequently used in real-world applications, such as `ember-concurrency`, need to be able to enable these flags.

Embroider is a really important next step for the future of Ember. It would be helpful for anyone interested to test out Embroider readiness in their addon or application in `splitAtRoutes` mode with these flags enabled and provide feedback. If you are inclined, head on over to the [meta issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19099) and give it a read.

It is worth mentioning that other things need to be done in order to get Embroider stabilized for use in Ember. You can check that list out in [Ed Faulkner's (@ef4)](https://github.com/ef4) [tracking issue](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/501).

## [New free video and instructor at EmberMap üìπ](https://twitter.com/ember_map/status/1295828816011636743)

EmberMap has a new instructor! [Lindsay Cade (@cadeParade)](https://github.com/cadeParade) has joined the EmberMap crew and released her first video, which covers testing loading states üéâ. Bonus, this instructional video is free!

Lindsay teaches us how to use the wait helpers built into `ember-test-helpers` to ensure that you can write robust tests around loading state that wait for async behavior to resolve before making assertions.

Check out the free video at [EmberMap](https://embermap.com/video/testing-loading-states).
