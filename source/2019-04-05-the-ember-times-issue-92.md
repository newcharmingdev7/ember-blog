## [Animations and Predictable Data Loading in Ember 🐹](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/)

[@ijlee2](https://github.com/ijlee2) a recent attendee at [Ember Conf 2019](https://emberconf.com/) shares an [tutorial](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/) on how to load complex data in a predictable manor and how to use animations to liven up your ember applications. 

The tutorial covers how you can use simple animations using [Ember animated](https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated] and [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) to help make your applications feel more dynamic and polished!

Another interesting area the tutorial explores is predictable data loading, overcoming bugs that you may encounter when having models and relationships and how you can use [Ember Data Storefront](https://github.com/embermap/ember-data-storefront) to aid tackling some of this issues! Defiantly worth checking out! 

Read the [full article](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/) alongside some video previews or checkout a preview of the [demo app](https://ember-animated.herokuapp.com/) from the tutorial.
