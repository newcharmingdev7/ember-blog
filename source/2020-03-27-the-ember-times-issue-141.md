## [Ember Autostash Modifier 💾](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1239325059656933376)

New modifier alert 🚨! [Preston Sego @NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) has created [`ember-autostash-modifier`](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-autostash-modifier) that stashes changes, binds those changes to a key, and restores those changes based on that key! 

This modifier is useful for chat apps, where you'd want to persist incomplete messages on a contact's page while the user navigates between other contacts before finishing and submitting a message, or where you want to bind component data based on the URL. Checkout this [demo](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-autostash-modifier/1) of the modifier in action.

It's so nice to see the eco-system of Ember modifiers continue to grow 😀, we can't wait to see what the awesome folks in the Ember community come up with next!
