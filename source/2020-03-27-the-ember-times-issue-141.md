## [Stand Alone EmberConf 2020 Videos Are Out 🎥](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkC03mdzlyej6tcbEqrZK8N)

If you missed part or all of the ✨✨**amazing EmberConf 2020** ✨✨, now's your chance to catch up on all the great talks à la carte! While the live streams have been available since the days they were streamed, now you can watch them as stand alone talks. 

If you want to re-live some of the best moments, or watch them for the first time, you can find the complete library of videos 📼 available for your viewing pleasure on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkC03mdzlyej6tcbEqrZK8N). Be sure not to miss the BonusConf sessions which are included in this list!

Again, don't forget to check out all the related resources for the talks in [the conference notes](https://twitter.com/alex_diliberto/status/1240449629612892161) by [Alex DiLiberto (@alexdiliberto)](https://github.com/alexdiliberto). 

Also one more reminder! We have a request for those of you who attended **EmberConf 2020**:

> Tell us about someone new that you got to chat with at the virtual conf!

Let us know about your answer to this question either by [tweeting us via Twitter](https://twitter.com/embertimes) using the **hashtag #EmberConFriends** or as a message on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs) in the **#support-ember-times** channel. We will raffle an exclusive **EmberConf retro sticker set** among all story writers by April 6, 2020. We're looking forward to hear from you and happy catching up on virtual EmberConf!
