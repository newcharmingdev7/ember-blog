**This is the twenty-ninth in our DecEmber seriesâ€“"Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons". We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day 29

Before I took on this assignment, I didn't know anything about [ember-code-snippet](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-code-snippet). Now, I'm glad that I did. This addon surfaced in 2015, has received regular updates, and powers one of the most used addons. (Can you guess which one?)

### What It Does

[ember-code-snippet](https://github.com/ef4/ember-code-snippet) lets you render code snippets in your app (or addon). Quite handy if you want to create a technical blog or a component style guide.

It provides a helper called `get-code-snippet` so that (1) you can save code snippets in a dedicated folder and (2) create your own component to customize the look.

To illustrate the use, we'll consider a code snippet from [Ember.js Octane vs Classic Cheat Sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/):

```javascript
// my-app-name/snippets/make-your-own-elementId.js

import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { guidFor } from '@ember/object/internals';

export default class InputTextComponent extends Component {
  inputId = 'textInput-' + guidFor(this); 
}
```

The most basic use is to display the code in a `<pre>` block.

```handlebars
{{!-- my-app-name/app/templates/application.hbs --}}

{{#let (get-code-snippet "make-your-own-elementId.js") as |snippet|}}
    <!-- No syntax highlighting -->
    <pre><code>{{snippet.source}}</code></pre>
{{/let}}
```
