## [RFC: Improved Ember Registry APIs 🗒️®️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/585)

[Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) proposed adding a new, object-based API for all registry APIs; deprecate the current string-based microsyntax registry APIs; and introduce a `capabilities` property to the resolver to safely support existing resolvers.

The [RFC: Improved Ember Registry APIs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/585) covers the problems with the [microsyntax](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/applications/dependency-injection/#toc_factory-registrations) and the lack of TypeScript support. The RFC recommends adding a new `Identifier` API which would contain the `name`, `type`, and optionally the `namespace` fields instead of the current microsyntax. For example:

From:
```js
getOwner(this).lookup('service:session');
```

To:
```js
getOwner(this).lookup({ type: 'service', name: 'session' })
```

From:
```js
class Example {
  @service('global@session')
  session;
}
```

To:
```js
class Example {
  @service({ namespace: 'global', name: 'session' })
  session;
}
```

If you would like to learn more or add your feedback please take a look at the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/585)!
