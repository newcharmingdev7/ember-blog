## [Check Out New Content in the Official Ember Guides 🐹🤓](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/)

The most popular learning resource for early and advanced Ember developers,
the [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/), is waiting up for you with some **brand-new content**!

The Guides now feature a [new section](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/accessibility/) entirely dedicated to **accessibility**. It teaches you how to create your own accessibility strategy for your application, and how to implement keyboard accessible, screenreader accessible and overall barrier-free user interfaces with Ember. If you haven't done so, be sure to [check it out today](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/accessibility/) and leave either feedback or support for improving this section in the [#topic-a11y channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480523441082990612) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)!

Additionally, a soon-to-be-released version of the Guides will shine with [a revamp of the testing guidelines](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/testing/). In particular, the introduction to testing has been updated and a new section explaining the different types of tests in Ember apps has been [added](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/964). Many thanks to both [@ijlee2](https://github.com/ijlee2) for working on the update and [@toddjordan](https://github.com/toddjordan) for the detailed review and suggestions!

## [Ember-Backstop Visual Regression Testing Tutorial 🧪](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ember-backstop-visual-regression-testing-tutorial-garris-shipon/)

[@garris](https://github.com/garris) published a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ember-backstop-visual-regression-testing-tutorial-garris-shipon/) on how to add visual regression tests to your Ember application in 10 minutes with the [ember-backstop](https://github.com/garris/ember-backstop) test-helper addon.

You can import `ember-backstop` into your application test and await it at a point in time where you want to run the visual regression testing. It will then serialize the snapshot of your DOM at that moment in time and it will send it to the *Backstop-Remote* service. The tutorial goes through how to verify, fix, and approve visual regression tests using the Backstop commands.

Check out the full tutorial by following along with the [demo repository](https://github.com/garris/ember-backstop-tutorial/) or reading through the [BackstopJS website](http://backstopjs.org/) for more information.
