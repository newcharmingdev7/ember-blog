## [A New EmberMap Series: What's New in Ember 📚](https://embermap.com/topics/what-s-new-in-ember/)

This year, Ember released many new features that will all be a part of Ember Octane. While the [release notes](https://blog.emberjs.com/tags/releases.html) summarize the features well, you may have wondered still how to use them in your app.

To help you understand better, EmberMap started a series called [What's New in Ember](https://embermap.com/topics/what-s-new-in-ember/). Each episode will cover 1 new feature, starting with Ember 3.8.

In the first episode, [Sam Selikoff (@samselikoff)](https://github.com/samselikoff) shows how you can write a **modifier**. In particular, you will learn how to use Ember's **modifier manager** (this provides low-level, public APIs for customization) and dedicated **addons** (for high-level abstraction).

Be sure to check out the future episodes as they are released!

## [Ember-engines: the what, what not and why? – Part 1 📝](https://medium.com/developer-paradise/ember-engines-the-what-what-not-and-when-part-1-49187c949db5)
  
If you have ever heard something about **ember-engines** but you need to refresh your knowledge or they are completely new to you [@abhilashlr](https://github.com/abhilashlr) wrote a [blogpost](https://medium.com/developer-paradise/ember-engines-the-what-what-not-and-when-part-1-49187c949db5) about them. This first [blogpost](https://medium.com/developer-paradise/ember-engines-the-what-what-not-and-when-part-1-49187c949db5) nicely establishes what an ember-engine is, and emphasises what it is not. 
The [blogpost](https://medium.com/developer-paradise/ember-engines-the-what-what-not-and-when-part-1-49187c949db5) is part one, with part two on how  [@abhilashlr ](https://github.com/abhilashlr) used ember engines for one of his features in draft. So keep posted to learn more about how to use ember-engines, especially in large scale Ember apps.
