### What It Does

Ember Power Select provides a powerful select component, built from the ground up for Ember so that it works the way you expect an addon to in Ember. Exceptionally [well documented](https://ember-power-select.com/docs), Ember Power Select allows you to create everything from a straightforward list of text items to an asynchronous search driven select which incorporates graphical elements in the list. 

The addon's website includes a [cookbook](https://ember-power-select.com/cookbook) for more unusual requirements as well as a [list of community provided addons](https://ember-power-select.com/addons) which address functionality outside of the scope of Ember Power Select.

### Why I Like It

I have grown to love using Ember Power Select which developing a crud-rich web app which benefits from many instances of select elements driven by asynchronous searches. I have made use of the [cookbook](https://ember-power-select.com/cookbook) to debounce those searches and so reduce the load on the server while maintaining a slick feel to the interface. The look of the resulting selects is fine just as they but the [clearly documented API](https://ember-power-select.com/docs/api-reference) has allowed me to tweak each use of the addon and so provide a better experience to the users.

Although [some work](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-select/issues/1251) has been done to support Octane it appears that as of today this isn't yet complete.
