## Reason #1: [Community 🏆](https://emberjs.com/community)

One great reason to use Ember is the [community](https://emberjs.com/community) that you will be a part of. Ember provides a wide platform for everyone to be an active learner and contributor. Where will you discover yourself next?

This year, we surveyed 10 different ways to [learn](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/#MS_Q103) and [contribute](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/#MS_Q112)!

Our 5 most favorite places to learn: (drumrolls, please)

- Documentations (71%)
- [Ember.js blog](https://blog.emberjs.com/) (54%)
- RFCs (52%)
- Code samples (51%)
- Blog posts (47%)

And our 5 most favorite ways to give back: 🥁🥁🥁

- Attend Meetups and conferences (35%)
- Open issues (35%)
- Maintain addons (27%)
- Open PRs (24%)
- Answer community questions (16%)

I think it's great to see that we like to meet in person and share knowledge. Each year, you can meet fellow Ember devs at [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/), [EmberCamp] (http://embercamp.com/), and [EmberFest](https://emberfest.eu/). You can also meet them on a regular basis through Meetups ([find a Meetup near you](https://emberjs.com/community/meetups/)).

What can you do if there isn't a Meetup in your area? We'd like to suggest that you start small. Get together with a few friends for coffee or food, and catch up over latest Ember news. You can also throw a viewing party and watch together (1) past talks or (2) live streams 🍿🥤. If you'd like to know more about starting your own Meetup, you can join the `#meetup-organizers` channel on Discord where we'd be happy to help you. (Please contact `#discord-server-admin` to join this Meetup channel.)
