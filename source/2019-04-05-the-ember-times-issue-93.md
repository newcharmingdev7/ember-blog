## [Quest: Ember Engines Guides MVP 🚂](https://twitter.com/MVillander/status/1113833794237341696)

[@villander](https://github.com/villander) started a [quest issue](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines.com/issues/55) to tracking all the work left to do to get an MVP of the [Ember Engines](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines) Guides out!

There are tasks open from [moving docs](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines/issues/540) from the README to [ember-engines.com](http://www.ember-engines.com/) to [clarifying the philosophy](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines.com/issues/57) and intended uses for engines. Plenty for everyone with all levels of experience with Ember Engines to [contribute](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines.com/issues/55)!
