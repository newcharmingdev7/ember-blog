## [Record Data Errors RFC üìá](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/465)

<!--alex ignore invalid-->
[@igorT](https://github.com/igorT) created a RFC to expose the content of Invalid Errors on Record Data. This RFC suggests exposing the errors provided by the server if it returns a `422`. `InvalidError` payload follows the JSON API error object spec, and if the error payload contains pointers those get mapped to attributes on a record. 

For more information about the getter for the errors and the `RecordDataStoreWrapper` and an opportunity to give feedback, see the [Record Data Errors RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/465).

## [RFCs around EmberObject Base Class üí°](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pulls)

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) opened 2 new RFCs around using the `EmberObject` base class.

The [@classic Decorator RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/468) adds a set of warnings for users who adopt native class syntax with `EmberObject` base classes. By using the `@classic` decorator, the warnings around edge cases such as `init` vs `constructor` or use of `Mixins` are turned off. These warnings are used as a guide for components to slowly migrate away from extending from `EmberObject` to more standalone such as `GlimmerComponent`.

The [Injection Hook Normalization RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/467) supercedes the submitted [Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/451). This RFC looks to answer how we should handle dependency injection (DI) when we are not extending from the `EmberObject` base class. It proposes to assign values during construction by normalising the assignment of the `owner`, access to injected properties, and follow the same conventions as other popular DI frameworks.

## [Building a Hangman Game with Ember Octane](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400723351) üé¨

<!--alex ignore hangman-hangwoman-->
Husband and wife team [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) and [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang) did a [live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400723351) on how to build a simple hangman game. They used [the Ember Octane preview](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) and the Glimmer components that come with it. 

This video is a nice introduction into the world of Ember Octane and Glimmer components and definitely shows the benefits of doing pair programming üòä.
