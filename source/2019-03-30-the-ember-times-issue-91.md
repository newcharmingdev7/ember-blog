## RFCs Around EmberObject Base Class üí°

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) opened 2 new RFCs around using the `EmberObject` base class.

The [@classic Decorator RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/468) adds a set of warnings for users who adopt native class syntax with `EmberObject` base classes. By using the `@classic` decorator, the warnings around edge cases such as `init` vs `constructor` or use of `Mixins` are turned off. These warnings are used as a guide for components to slowly migrate away from extending from `EmberObject` to more standalone such as `GlimmerComponent`.

The [Injection Hook Normalization RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/467) supercedes the submitted [Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/451). This RFC looks to answer how we should handle dependency injection (DI) when we are not extending from the `EmberObject` base class. It proposes to assign values during construction by normalising the assignment of the `owner`, access to injected properties, and follow the same conventions as other popular DI frameworks.

Read more about [@classic Decorator RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/468) and [Injection Hook Normalization RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/467) on GitHub!
