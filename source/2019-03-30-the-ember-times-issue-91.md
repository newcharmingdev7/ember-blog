## [Record Data Errors RFC 📇](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/465)

<!--alex ignore invalid-->
[@igorT](https://github.com/igorT) created a RFC to expose the content of Invalid Errors on Record Data. This RFC suggests exposing the errors provided by the server if it returns a `422`. `InvalidError` payload follows the JSON API error object spec, and if the error payload contains pointers those get mapped to attributes on a record. 

For more information about the getter for the errors and the `RecordDataStoreWrapper` and an opportunity to give feedback, see the [Record Data Errors RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/465).

## [Building a Hangman Game with Ember Octane](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400723351) 🎬

<!--alex ignore hangman-hangwoman-->
Husband and wife team [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) and [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang) did a [live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400723351) on how to build a simple hangman game. They used [the Ember Octane preview](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) and the Glimmer components that come with it. 

This video is a nice introduction into the world of Ember Octane and Glimmer components and definitely shows the benefits of doing pair programming 😊.
