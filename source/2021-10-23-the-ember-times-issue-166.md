## [RFC: Deprecate transition methods of Controller and Route ‚úçÔ∏è](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/674)

[Jeldrik Hanschke (@jelhan)](https://github.com/jelhan) proposed a new RFC to [Deprecate transition methods of Controller and Route](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/674) in order to reduce public API exposed related to routing.

The RFC aims to deprecate the methods `transitionTo` and `replaceWith` of the Route object and the methods `transitionToRoute` and `replaceRoute` of the Controller object. The existing methods `transitionTo` and `replaceWith` of the RouterService object should be used instead.

The RFC proposes that the existing methods are today not documented properly so there are likely timing differences between the different routing calls even if from the outside they function the same. Supporting different ways to do the same increases complexity without providing much value and limiting options will make learning the framework easier for new developers.

Read and comment on the [full RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/674)!

## [Learn what's new in Ember 3.22 release üéâ](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/10/20/ember-3-22-released.html)

<!--alex ignore host-hostess-->
The Ember Blog [announced the v3.22 releases](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/10/20/ember-3-22-released.html) of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. There were a host of bug fixes across the board, one deprecation for Ember Data and several new features for Ember.js.

The release of version 3.22 introduced some new features you may want to be aware of in Ember.js:

<!--alex ignore savage-->
1. Enabled `@ember/destroyable` API, which allows you to create and manage your own destroyables. For more information, please see the [Destroyables RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0580-destroyables.html).
2. Enabled Cache API, a low-level primitive for memoizing the result of a function based on autotracking. (You can install a [polyfill](https://github.com/ember-polyfills/ember-cache-primitive-polyfill) for apps between versions 3.13 and 3.21.) For more information, please check the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/autotracking-in-depth/#toc_caching-of-tracked-properties) and [Autotracking Memoization RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0615-autotracking-memoization.html).
3. Allowed passing the `transition` object to 2 route hooks, `activate` and `deactivate`.

Additionally Ember Data 3.22 introduced a deprecation for use of `najax` in favor of `ember-fetch` when fastboot is installed, and for new apps Ember CLI 3.22 will install v9 or higher of `eslint-plugin-ember`, which may limit the version of Node that you use.

The release also kicked off the 3.23 beta cycle. If you can, please help with testing beta builds and reporting bugs before version 3.23.0 is published.

## [Blog: React Component Patterns in Ember.js ‚öõÔ∏è](https://www.effective-ember.com/blog/react-component-patterns/)

[Michael Klein (@LevelbossMike)](https://github.com/LevelbossMike) wrote a blog post comparing modern Ember with React. While not expert on React, the blog goes through how [React tackles challenges](https://dev.to/alexi_be3/react-component-patterns-49ho) when implementing SPAs. The blog goes through 3 different component patterns: Compound Component Pattern, Flexible Compound Component Pattern, and Provider Pattern - to see how each one is implemented in React and Ember.

<!--alex ignore obvious-->
The blog argues that the [Octane Edition](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) of Ember provides conventions that help you fall into the pit of success instead of only giving you low-level primitives to solve common challenges in a multitude of ways with different tradeoffs that only seem to be obvious to people that are experts in React.

Read the full blog post where Michael compares each pattern with code samples in the [Effective Ember blog](https://www.effective-ember.com/blog/react-component-patterns/)!
