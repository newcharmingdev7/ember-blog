## [Stories of becoming a developer 📖](https://dev.to/agathebadia/share-your-dev-story-51dg)

[Agathe Badia (@honeypotio)](https://github.com/Agathebadia) has written a blog post called **Share your Dev story**, this blog post introduces her new website 🎉 that was built with [ember.js](https://emberjs.com/), and it is called [Becoming a Developer](https://becoming-a-developer.netlify.app/). 

This site is where developers can share their background, the story of how they started, interest in development, studies, first developer role, and some recommendations for anyone starting or continuing to dive into development. 💻

In her [Share your Dev story](https://dev.to/agathebadia/share-your-dev-story-51dg) post, she talks about how meaningful her new website is to her, and her passion as a Jr. developer shines. 🌟

The Developers' stories shared are **inspiring** and **insightful**, and developers are telling their stories with all kinds of different backgrounds. Check it out, and it could inspire **you** to do something you never thought possible! 😃
