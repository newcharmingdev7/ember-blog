## [Talk Video: Visual Regression Testing Made Easy 📺](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ZCJNeybbs)

[@patocallaghan](https://github.com/patocallaghan) gave a lightning talk on “Visual Regression Testing Made Easy” at the April 2019 [DublinJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/). In his talk, Pat used [Percy](https://percy.io/) to scale testing visual regressions from manually doing them to having it automated. You can detect potential CSS bugs, remove certain types of tests, and make large refactoring and migrations. “Styles can sometimes make bad things happen.” Percy gives you confidence when you make big changes.

Check out the [full lightning talk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ZCJNeybbs) just published this week!

## [Prune Your App with Ember Unused Components ♻️](https://github.com/vastec/ember-unused-components)

Sorting out **components**, which are not used in your application anymore, can be tough. With different ways to invoke components, such as curly brace or [angle bracket syntax](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/reference/syntax-conversion-guide/) and the syntactical ambiguity of invoking helpers and components, it takes some time to prune your app from redundant components manually.

But now you can use the brand-new addon [Ember Unused Components](https://github.com/vastec/ember-unused-components) to **clean up** your **codebase automatically**. Use the `--stats` flag to get **useful reports** on the impact of your app optimization efforts as you go. [Check it out today!](https://github.com/vastec/ember-unused-components)
