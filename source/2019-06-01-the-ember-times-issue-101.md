## [#EmberJS2019 🛣🗺](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)
  
🚨 Blog posts wanted! 🚨 

We would like you to write a blog post to propose **goals and direction** for Ember for the next year. The content of these posts will help the Core Team to draft their **next Roadmap RFC**. 

<a class="ember-button ember-button--centered" href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html">Read more about the Roadmap RFC</a>

Looking to see what's already out there? Posts are being gathered at [this community repo](https://github.com/abhilashlr/emberjs2019-posts) - thanks [@abhilashlr](https://github.com/abhilashlr)! We also wanted to share some highlights from posts out there in the Times.

[@ijlee2](https://github.com/ijlee2) wants Ember to [Build a Larger Community](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/05/26/emberjs2019-build-a-larger-community/).

> Our community, while [truly amazing and supportive](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/04/12/the-ember-times-issue-93.html), is yet small. To flourish, we need **support from developers who don’t work with Ember daily**. These developers may professionally work with React, Angular, or Vue. They may be self-taught or attending school, looking to enter tech with minimal risk in career trajectory and minimal time to create showcase projects.

He shares three concrete ideas to make growing Ember a reality:

> 1. Publish a better [website](https://emberjs.com/) - address design and content
> 2. Promote [Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) heavily
> 3. Teach Ember at local and remote [Meetups](https://emberjs.com/community/meetups)
