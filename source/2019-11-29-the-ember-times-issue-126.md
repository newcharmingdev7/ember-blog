## [State of JavaScript 2019 Survey 📃](https://stateofjs.com/)

It’s that time of year again! Please make sure to fill out the [State of JavaScript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/) and represent **Ember**!

In 2018 the survey collected over 20,000 responses from developers to identify current and upcoming trends. This year, the survey is once again looking for how developers use JavaScript with regards to syntax, browser APIs, and mobile vs desktop web.

All questions are optional and reaching 100% completion is not required so give it a try and answer the [State of JavaScript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/) today! Hint: The survey asks about **Ember** under "Front-end Frameworks."

## [Latest Updates to Octane Guides 🙏](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/)

Documentation is integral to helping us understand how to use open source projects like Ember and its addons. Documentation is so common in our lives that we tend to overlook how much work is involved in creating and maintaining one.

Today, we extend our hearty thanks to [@sly7-7](https://github.com/sly7-7) and [@venusang](https://github.com/venusang). @sly7-7 proofread and updated several code examples in the [Octane Guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/), while @venusang added instructions for using element modifiers in the [Ember.js Octane vs. Classic Cheat Sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/) (we highly recommend bookmarking this page!).

If you can contribute to everyone's learning today, we ask that you help **update the readme of your favorite addon** to provide code examples in Octane.

## [More Improvements Coming to Ember Inspector Soon 🚀](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1088)

A huge shoutout and thank you are owed to [Godfrey Chan @chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) and [Robert Wagner @rwwagner90](https://github.com/rwwagner90), the maintainer of the Ember Inspector, and everyone else involved for all their amazing work in getting the new and improved **Ember Inspector** ready for Octane! 🔥🔥🔥

With the release of Octane coming it is welcomed news that Octane's Glimmer components work in Ember Inspector now, in both the component tree and the object inspector. Other improvements include revamping the component hover inspection tool to match Chrome's inspection style, many bug fixes and a complete rewrite of the component tree logic that is more future proof.

[Godfrey Chan @chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode), in particular, is owed a big thanks for helping design the `captureRenderTree` API in Ember that was needed to provide the Inspector with the information it needs and for providing a polyfill, so it works seamlessly across versions.

Also many thanks to [Patrick @patricklx](https://github.com/patricklx) for a lot of recent work in getting inspector ready for Octane, including compatibility with Octane's tracked properties.

If you'd like to help test out all the new functionality, there is an open [PR with the changes](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1088). Please let [Robert Wagner @rwwagner90](https://github.com/rwwagner90) and the Inspector team know if you encounter any issues!
