## [State of JavaScript 2019 Survey 📃](https://stateofjs.com/)

It’s that time of year again! Please make sure to fill out the [State of JavaScript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/) and represent **Ember**!

In 2018 the survey collected over 20,000 responses from developers to identify current and upcoming trends. This year, the survey is once again looking for how developers use JavaScript with regards to syntax, browser APIs, and mobile vs desktop web.

All questions are optional and reaching 100% completion is not required so give it a try and answer the [State of JavaScript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/) today! Hint: The survey asks about **Ember** under "Front-end Frameworks."

## [All Things Ember and Tailwind 🎨](https://www.balinterdi.com/blog/purging-css-in-ember-postcss-purgecss/)

Are you on the functional CSS train 🚂? Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. [Balint Erdi (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi) recently blogged about Ember, Tailwind and PostCSS. In [his first post](https://www.balinterdi.com/blog/ember-tailwind-css-postcss-import/), Balint explains how with [ember-auto-import](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import), you can use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) directly versus relying on the Ember-specific integrator package. (ember-cli-tailwind was deprecated, because this worked so well!) However, to make your Ember app integrate nicely with Post CSS, Balint suggests sticking with the integrator add-on [ember-cli-postcss](https://github.com/jeffjewiss/ember-cli-postcss). Check out [post-css-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) to be able to import styles from other files.

In his [second post](https://www.balinterdi.com/blog/purging-css-in-ember-postcss-purgecss/), Balint details how he added Purgecss to the mix. [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) is a library that removes unused CSS, thus reducing the bundle size. Be sure to check out [Chris Masters (@chrism)](https://github.com/chrism)'s working example in his detailed **[emberjs-tailwind-purgecss README](https://github.com/chrism/emberjs-tailwind-purgecss)**. Balint also touches on using Purgecss only in production, which has its pros and cons. We definitely enjoyed the discussion about these blog posts on the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/baaz/status/1198982126860935168). Happy Tailwind-ing!

## [Latest Updates to Octane Guides 🙏](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/)

Documentation is integral to helping us understand how to use open source projects like Ember and its addons. Documentation is so common in our lives that we tend to overlook how much work is involved in creating and maintaining one.

Today, we extend our hearty thanks to [@sly7-7](https://github.com/sly7-7) and [@venusang](https://github.com/venusang). @sly7-7 proofread and updated several code examples in the [Octane Guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/), while @venusang added instructions for using element modifiers in the [Ember.js Octane vs. Classic Cheat Sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/) (we highly recommend bookmarking this page!).

If you can contribute to everyone's learning today, we ask that you help **update the readme of your favorite addon** to provide code examples in Octane.
