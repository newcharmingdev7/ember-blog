## Ember Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emberjs/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emberjs/website)

The website for the Ember.js project.

### Contributing

To get started:

## Running locally with Docker (recommended)

## Running locally with Ruby and Middleman

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/emberjs/website.git
cd website
bundle
bundle exec middleman
```

Then visit [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

**Note**: unless you're working with the API docs, don't use `rake preview`â€”use `middleman` (aka `middleman server`) instead.

To populate organizers data from meetup.com on [http://localhost:4567/meetups](http://localhost:4567/meetups)

  * get a [meetup API Key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)
  * set `ENV["MEETUP_API_KEY"]`
  * run the following rake command

``` sh
rake findorganizers [force=true]

The force=true flag will overwrite all existing organizer data
```

#### API Documentation

API documentation has been moved to a separate repo, please see https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/

### Requirements

If the `bundle` command is not found, you can install it with `gem install bundle`.

If the `bundle` command fails to run, you may need to upgrade your Ruby version. Please check the current supported version that described at [.ruby-version](https://github.com/emberjs/website/blob/master/.ruby-version).
You can use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to install it:

``` sh
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
$ rvm install $(cat .ruby-version)
$ rvm use $(cat .ruby-version)
```

### Troubleshooting tips for Windows devs

For Windows developers using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/), you'll need to [download the DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads) and install it using instructions:
https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit

After you have a proper install, you can then run:
``` sh
gem install bundler wdm tzinfo-data
gem update listen middleman
```

Once Middleman comes up, you'll be prompted by Windows Firewall. Click "Allow access" and you'll be in business!
