    ```bash
    # Set upstream (one-time operation)
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog

    # Get branches and commits from upstream
    git fetch upstream

    # Switch to the current Ember Times branch
    git switch -t upstream/blog/embertimes-167
    ```

1. Open the Markdown file for the current blog issue: `source/2020-10-09-the-ember-times-issue-165.md`.

    <change section title emoji>
    <consider adding some bold to your paragraph>
    <please include link to external article/repo/etc in paragraph / body text, not just header title above>

    <add your name to author list, top and bottom>
