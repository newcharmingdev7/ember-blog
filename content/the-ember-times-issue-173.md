## [Beta release of ember-template-lint v3 ✅](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1349820518216708096)

[ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint) which is a linter for template files in Ember has released a [beta version of 3.0.0](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.0). This release will include the TODO feature which will help teams adopt the latest version of ember-template-lint and immediately apply linting rules to new code while allowing time to resolve existing issues.

As part of the 3.0.0 beta release, a lot of rules have also been [turned on in the default recommended config](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/pull/1643). This version will also [promote the octane config](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/pull/1639) into the default recommended config.

Check out the full [plan for the 3.0.0 release](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/issues/1315) on GitHub.
