## [üéÉ 1. Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is an annual, worldwide celebration organized by DigitalOcean and sponsored by many companies that use open source software.
Many Ember projects are participating this year! If you complete the challenge,
you can get a prize!

To participate:

- Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.
- Make 4 approved Pull Requests to public repositories on GitHub that have the `hacktoberfest` topic.
Take a moment to learn about what goes into an ["approved" Pull request](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/participation).
- If you are among the first 50,000 developers who complete the challenge, you get a prize. This year, you can select between a T-shirt and a tree planted in your name.
- Join the [`#hacktoberfest`](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/496453502298750988) channel in the [Ember Community Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs)
to collaborate with other participants!

### Ember projects you can help out with

Are you wondering what to work on?

There are [81 Ember projects participating](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aember+topic%3Ahacktoberfest)!
Here's a list of [recently updated issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=topic%3Aember+topic%3Ahacktoberfest&s=updated&type=Repositories) in those repositories.

Ember 4.0 is coming up, and so one area of need is to help addon maintainers
upgrade to version 3.28 and [resolve deprecations](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/). Even if addon authors
do not have issues open for this work, you can open one and offer to help.

You can also visit [Ember's Help Wanted](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/) to find good issues to work on. The Ember Learning Team and others are curating some super beginner-friendly issues. In Help Wanted, you can find these issues, along with more intermediate and advanced issues. If you want to help, comment on an issue to let others know that you are working on it. If the issue you want to work on is taken, try asking if the other volunteers would like to collaborate!

### Connect with other participants

Join the `#hacktoberfest` channel in the [Ember Community Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs) to connect with other developers. You can find a buddy to pair with, a mentor to guide you, or toss around ideas.

If you are someone who is willing to help mentor new contributors, please let us know in `#hacktoberfest` on Discord. Addon maintainers are welcome to post issues they need help with too!

<!--alex ignore gal-guy -->
Additionally, there are several more groups within the Ember Community Discord where you can find others to collaborate with. There are Discord channels for women, LGBTQ+, and people of color. If you belong to one of those groups, you can ask to join in the `#discord-server-admin` channel.

## [Release of ember-popperjs üéâ](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1444713887220240400)

[NullVoxPopuli (@NullVoxPopuli)](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) released v1.0.0 of [ember-popperjs](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-popperjs) which provides a single `<PopperJS>` component with with APIs to create popover, tooltips, and more!

The addon provides 2 modifiers: `{{trigger}}` which sets up the target element for the popover element to position itself to ‚Äì and `{{popover}}` which attaches to the element that is the container of the popover content. There are also `placement` and `options` attributes which can be applied to [customize](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/constructors/#options) the `<PopperJS>` behaviour.

```hbs
<PopperJS as |trigger popover|>
  <button {{trigger}} {{on "click" this.yourClickHandler}}>
    {{yield to="trigger"}}
  </button>

  {{#if this.yourVisibilityIndicator}}
    <div {{popover}}>
      This is a popover!
      {{yield to="default"}}
    </div>
  {{/if}}
</PopperJS>
```

Note that PopperJS does not provide styles for making a popover nor does it provide click handlers for showing and hiding the popover. Try it out today, it‚Äôs available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-popperjs)!
