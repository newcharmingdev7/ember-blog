👋 Emberistas! 🐹

It's October, and that means its time for Hacktoberfest!

---

## [🎃 1. Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is an annual, worldwide celebration organized by DigitalOcean and sponsored by many companies that use open source software.
Many Ember projects are participating this year! If you complete the challenge,
you can get a prize!

To participate:

- Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.
- Make 4 approved Pull Requests to public repositories on GitHub that have the `hacktoberfest` topic.
Take a moment to learn about what goes into an ["approved" Pull request](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/participation).
- If you are among the first 50,000 developers who complete the challenge, you get a prize. This year, you can select between a T-shirt and a tree planted in your name.
- Join the `#hacktoberfest` channel in the [Ember Community Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs)
to collaborate with other participants!

### Ember projects you can help out with

Are you wondering what to work on?

There are [81 Ember projects participating](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aember+topic%3Ahacktoberfest)!
Here's a list of [recently updated issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=topic%3Aember+topic%3Ahacktoberfest&s=updated&type=Repositories) in those repositories.

Ember 4.0 is coming up, and so one area of need is to help addon maintainers
upgrade to version 3.28 and resolve deprecations. Even if addon authors
do not have issues open for this work, you can open one and offer to help.

You can also visit [Ember's Help Wanted](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/) to find good issues to work on. The Ember Learning Team and others are curating some super beginner-friendly issues. In Help Wanted, you can find these issues, along with more intermediate and advanced issues. If you want to help, comment on an issue to let others know that you are working on it. If the issue you want to work on is taken, try asking if the other volunteers would like to collaborate!

### Connect with other participants

Join the `#hacktoberfest` channel in the [Ember Community Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs) to connect with other developers. You can find a buddy to pair with, a mentor to guide you, or toss around ideas.

If you are someone who is willing to help mentor new contributors, please let us know in `#hacktoberfest` on Discord. Addon maintainers are welcome to post issues they need help with too!

Additionally, there are several more groups within the Ember Community Discord where you can find others to collaborate with. There are Discord channels for women, LGBTQ+, and people of color. If you belong to one of those groups, you can ask to join in the `#discord-server-admin` channel.
