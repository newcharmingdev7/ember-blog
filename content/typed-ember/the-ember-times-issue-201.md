Robert Wagner (@rwwagner90) and Chuck Carpenter (@chuckcarpenter) of Ship Shape sit down with Chris Krycho(@chriskrycho) in this episode of [Whiskey, Web and Whatnot](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm). Chris shares his initial work on getting TypeScript into Ember, how Typed-Ember got established, further on explaining the need and long term benefits.

They also discuss about the enthusiasm of newbies to use TypeScript and the complexities that might arise. If you want to know factors to consider when deciding to use TypeScript, they discuss a few. Chris suggests developers to learn Rust programming because learning functional programming helps broadening your horizon.
