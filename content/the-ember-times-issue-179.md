## [A Comparison of Rendering Engines of React, Angular, and Ember 🌐](https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2021/5/2018311514916341034)

[Eine große Überraschung](https://twitter.com/jelhan1/status/1384931700036222981) from [Jeldrik Hanschke (@jelhan)](https://github.com/jelhan): The May issue of iX, a computer magazine from Germany, features the article [Die Rendering-Engines von React, Angular und Ember im Vergleich](https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2021/5/2018311514916341034).

The article is written for developers at all levels. Jeldrik provides a naive rendering engine to motivate the performance problems that it will encounter. Afterwards, you will get to learn how computer science helped create rendering engines that are performant.

How do React, Angular, and Ember turn your single-page application code into what the user sees? What are the strengths and weaknesses in their approach? If you want to learn more about rendering engines, we encourage you to check out [Jeldrik's article in iX](https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2021/5/2018311514916341034)!

## [May 20th is Global Accessibility Awareness Day 💟](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1389703699241578502?s=20)

[Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Accessibility_Awareness_Day), an awareness day focusing on digital access and inclusion for the more than one billion people with disabilities and impairments, will be celebrated on May 20, 2021. Here are some suggestions from [Melanie Sumner (@MelSumner)](https://github.com/MelSumner) on how you can get involved in some accessibility (a11y) related open source projects!

1. Help convert [ember-component-patterns](https://github.com/ember-components/ember-component-patterns) from Gitbook to an Ember app
2. Help with [a11y-automation.dev](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation) which is a project to track a11y automation
3. Check out the [help wanted page](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/ember-a11y) for issues in the [ember-a11y GitHub organization](https://github.com/ember-a11y)
4. Help write some [a11y-related linting rules](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aa11y) for ember-template-lint

For more ideas please check out the [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) website](https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/)!

## [Ember Apollo Client + `@use` 💡](https://dev.to/chrismllr/ember-apollo-client-use-5h3o)

In a new app, [Chris Miller (@chrismllr)](https://github.com/chrismllr) got to try out [ember-apollo-client](https://github.com/ember-graphql/ember-apollo-client), a GraphQL client for Ember apps. 🧡

Chris summarized his learning in the article [Ember Apollo Client + `@use`](https://dev.to/chrismllr/ember-apollo-client-use-5h3o). The article concerns the following question:

- Ember provides a few possible ways to fetch data. Which way do we follow with `ember-apollo-client` in the equation?

Towards the end, Chris shows how to use the `@use` API (from [ember-could-get-used-to-this](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-could-get-used-to-this)) to wrap `ember-apollo-client` methods. This solution may apply to other data-fetching APIs, such as Ember Data.

Interested in learning more? Check out [Ember Apollo Client + `@use`](https://dev.to/chrismllr/ember-apollo-client-use-5h3o) today!
