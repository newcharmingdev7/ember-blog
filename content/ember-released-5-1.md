Today the Ember project is releasing version 5.1 of Ember.js, EmberData, and Ember CLI.

This release kicks off the 5.2 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

## Ember.js

Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.

The headlining feature of this release is stable [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) support! ðŸŽ‰ The framework now publishes TypeScript types built from Ember's own source code, with Ember's [strong Semantic Versioning commitment](https://emberjs.com/releases/) baked inâ€”bringing benefits for both TypeScript and JavaScript users. For details, a couple important caveats, and a migration guide, check out [the accompanying blog post][stable-ember-types].

## Ember CLI

Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js applications.

### Upgrading Ember CLI

You may upgrade Ember CLI using the `ember-cli-update` project:

```bash
npx ember-cli-update
```

This utility will help you to update your app or addon to the latest Ember CLI version. You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which the default behavior is to let you resolve conflicts on your own. For more information on the `ember-cli-update` project, see [the GitHub README](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update).

While it is recommended to keep Ember CLI versions in sync with Ember and EmberData, this is not required. After updating ember-cli, you can keep your current version(s) of Ember or EmberData by editing `package.json` to revert the changes to the lines containing `ember-source` and `ember-data`.

[#10276](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10256) - Widen peer dependency range for ember-source.

## Thank You!

As a community-driven open-source project with an ambitious scope, each of these releases serves as a reminder that the Ember project would not have been possible without your continued support. We are extremely grateful to our contributors for their efforts.
