## [🗳️ 1. Fill out the Ember Community Survey by April 7th!](https://emberjs.com/survey/2022/)
  
The annual [Ember Community Survey](https://emberjs.com/survey/2022/) helps guide direction in the Ember ecosystem.
Data informs project prioritization, it sparks new ideas, and reveals opportunities for growth.
The Ember core teams would love to hear from you!
  
The survey is primarily intended for developers who use the Ember JavaScript framework, either for work or personal use, although any developer is welcome to fill out this survey. The survey should take approximately 15 minutes to complete in full, though all questions are optional.
  
[Learn more about the survey and fill it out](https://emberjs.com/survey/2022/) by April 7th!
