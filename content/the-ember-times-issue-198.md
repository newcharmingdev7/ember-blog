## [üó≥Ô∏è 1. Fill out the Ember Community Survey by April 7th!](https://emberjs.com/survey/2022/)
  
The annual [Ember Community Survey](https://emberjs.com/survey/2022/) helps guide direction in the Ember ecosystem.
Data informs project prioritization, it sparks new ideas, and reveals opportunities for growth.
The Ember core teams would love to hear from you!
  
The survey is primarily intended for developers who use the Ember JavaScript framework, either for work or personal use, although any developer is welcome to fill out this survey. The survey should take approximately 15 minutes to complete in full, though all questions are optional.
  
[Learn more about the survey and fill it out](https://emberjs.com/survey/2022/) by April 7th!

## [Blog post: Making your dynamic Ember components work with Embroider üí•](https://simplabs.com/blog/2022/03/17/dynamic-components-embroider/)

[Nick Schot (@nickschot)](https://github.com/nickschot) wrote a blog post on [making your dynamic Ember components work with Embroider](https://simplabs.com/blog/2022/03/17/dynamic-components-embroider/). [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider) is the future build system for Ember apps which unlocks features like splitting code per route by statically analyzing your codebase and dependencies. Dynamic components are components that are resolved at run-time rather than hardcoding the component to use using the [component helper](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/component?anchor=component) (e.g. `{{component "my-component"}}`).

Dynamic components are not by default compatible with Embroider's route-splitting feature since Embroider needs to be able to statically resolve components at build time. In the blog Nick discusses how they migrated [ember-promise-modals](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-promise-modals), an addon that relies on dynamic components, to be compatible with Embroider. They first used the `packageRules` as a compatibility feature to tell Embroider that an argument in the addon represents a component name.

To fully leverage Embroider‚Äôs code splitting, they used the `ensure-safe-component` helper that [Embroider provides](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/main/REPLACING-COMPONENT-HELPER.md) to turn a component class into a component definition that can be invoked in the template. This way the app code can be updated to actually import the component class so that Embroider can statically resolve this component.

## Ember Addon Roundup üåé

We‚Äôve had several addons across the Ember ecosystem converted to v2 format recently!

- [Luke Melia (@lukemelia)](https://github.com/lukemelia) released `ember-keyboard` [8.0.0](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-keyboard/releases/tag/v8.0.0)
- [Miguel Andrade (@miguelcobain)](https://github.com/miguelcobain) released `ember-css-transitions` [4.0.0](https://github.com/peec/ember-css-transitions/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
- [Edward Faulkner (@ef4)](https://github.com/ef4) released [ember-animated v1.0.0](https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- [Edward Faulkner (@ef4)](https://github.com/ef4) released [ember-animated-tools v1.0.0](https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated-tools/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

There is number of benefits to users of addons published in v2 format, some of which include:

- faster builds and faster NPM installs
- "zero-config import from NPM ‚Äî both static and dynamic" as a first-class feature that works for both third-party libraries and Ember addons
- support for arbitrary code splitting
- tree-shaking of unused modules, components, helpers, etc. from the app and all addons

To read more about v2 Addon Format, please check out [RFC 507](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-embroider-v2-package-format.md).

If you'd like to help ecosystem move forward and convert more addons to v2 format, you may follow great guide [Porting an Addon to V2](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/main/PORTING-ADDONS-TO-V2.md) made by [Edward Faulkner (@ef4)](https://github.com/ef4) or try [ember-addon-migrator](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-addon-migrator) by [NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli).
