Today the Ember project is releasing version 4.3 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI.

This release kicks off the 4.3 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

## Ember.js

Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.

### Changes in Ember.js 4.3

Ember.js 4.3 is an incremental, backwards compatible release of Ember with bug fixes, performance improvements, and minor deprecations.

#### Bug Fixes

Ember.js 4.3 introduced 3 bug fixes.

- Memory leak in the Router Service class is fixed ([#20025](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/20025)). This affected both tests and FastBoot, where we construct new instances of the service whenever we call the `visit` API.
- Donâ€™t serialize default Query Params on RouterService ([#19971](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19971)). Using `RouterService#transitionTo` does no longer add unspecified query parameters to the URL.
- Correctly associate props with factory and owner in FactoryManager ([#20024](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/20024))

#### Features

Support for the `toJSON` method on Ember Data records has been removed. It was deprecated in `3.x` and slated for removal in `4.x`.

For more details on changes in Ember Data 4.3, please review the
[Ember Data 4.3.0 commits](https://github.com/emberjs/data/compare/v4.1.0...v4.3.0).

## Ember CLI

Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js applications.

### Upgrading Ember CLI

You may upgrade Ember CLI using the `ember-cli-update` project:

```bash
npx ember-cli-update
```

This utility will help you to update your app or addon to the latest Ember CLI version. You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which the default behavior is to let you resolve conflicts on your own. For more information on the `ember-cli-update` project, see [the GitHub README](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update).

While it is recommended to keep Ember CLI versions in sync with Ember and Ember Data, this is not required. After updating ember-cli, you can keep your current version(s) of Ember or Ember Data by editing `package.json` to revert the changes to the lines containing `ember-source` and `ember-data`.

### Changes in Ember CLI 4.3

#### Bug Fixes

Ember CLI 4.3 introduced 1 bug fix.

- The broccoli debug folder is added to the `gitignore` file ([#9680](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/9680)).

#### Features

Ember CLI 4.3 introduced 2 features.

- Customisation of setupTest\* functions ([#9803](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/9803)). This adds a `tests/helpers/index.js` file where `setupApplicationTest`, `setupRenderingTest`, and `setupTest` functions will be wrapped and exported, creating a single place to edit for each type of test setup. Tests generated using `ember generate` will import the setup functions from that file.
- Add support for specifying a path for the `ember generate` command ([#9387](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/9387)). This allows you to run `ember g ../../../node_modules/ember-source/blueprints/component` to generate a component.

#### Deprecations

Ember CLI 4.3 introduced 1 deprecation.

- Deprecate Bower support ([#9707](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/9707)). This implements the deprecation messages from [RFC 772](https://github.com/bertdeblock/rfcs/blob/deprecate-bower-apis/text/0772-deprecate-bower-support.md).

instructions, please review the [Ember CLI 4.3.0 release page](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v4.3.0).

## Thank You!

As a community-driven open-source project with an ambitious scope, each of these releases serves as a reminder that the Ember project would not have been possible without your continued support. We are extremely grateful to our contributors for their efforts.
