## [EmberConf is this Monday üéâ](https://emberconf.com/)

EmberConf is **the best place** to meet the folks behind the magic, and Virtual EmberConf 2021 is this upcoming Monday and Tuesday! üôå [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/) is two days of Ember talks, sessions and fun -- streaming live virtually everywhere.

Hop onto the [Ember Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs) to start chatting with your Ember friends in the [#emberconf](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480502413917421570) channel. Starting this Monday, most EmberConf chatter will take place in [#ec-hallway](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/824756378814906435) and the dedicated-per-session channels under the "Virtual EmberConf" category.

Here at the Ember Times, we are super excited about the conference [lineup](https://emberconf.com/schedule/). Monday is an optional day of workshops and BonusConf streams, from "Debugging Your Brain" to "Introducing Template Imports". Tuesday's main event will be a full day of keynotes and technical sessions, including "Ending the Plague of Memory Leaks", "Fast-Track Ember with Fastboot + Embroider", "Typed Ember `extends` Confidence", and more. P.S. It's still possible to attend last minute!

* Tickets are $99. If you are unemployed, laid off, or a student, tickets are only $5. Tell a friend!
* Monday's will include two AMA's and you can submit your questions [here](https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/emberconf-2021-ama-questions/).
    * AMA with [Robert Jackson (@rwjblue)](https://github.com/rwjblue), hosted by [Melanie Sumner (@MelSumner)](https://github.com/melsumner)
    * AMA with [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats), hosted by [Julia Donaldson (@donaldsonjulia)](https://github.com/donaldsonjulia)

## [The ins and outs of organising EmberConf üìª](https://audio.ember.report/1680877/8115211-003-leah-silber-on-emberconf-2021)

In the latest [Ember Report](https://twitter.com/EmberReport) [podcast](https://audio.ember.report/1680877/8115211-003-leah-silber-on-emberconf-2021), [Leah Silber (@wifelette)](https://twitter.com/wifelette) talks about organising a remote EmberConf, the history of EmberConf, and additional topics like [inclusiveness](https://emberconf.com/about/inclusiveness-at-emberconf) that are so crucial to the EmberConf vibe.

This podcast gives a nice insight into the mind of a great conference organiser. There are also tips and pointers for people looking to organise conferences or meet-ups remotely and in real life.

In addition to how to organise a conference, Leah tells us about her favourite talks and the cool things that will happen at EmberConf 2021, such as workshops and the [kids track](https://emberconf.com/kids).

Be sure to check out the podcast episode, [Leah Silber on EmberConf 2021](https://audio.ember.report/1680877/8115211-003-leah-silber-on-emberconf-2021)!

## [Introducing: Glint, a typed-template solution for GlimmerX and Ember ‚ú®](https://www.salsify.com/blog/engineering/introducing-glint-a-typed-template-solution-for-glimmerx-and-ember)

Some [exciting news from the Typed Ember team](https://twitter.com/__dfreeman/status/1374765841158434816): You can use [Glint](https://github.com/typed-ember/glint) to **type check Ember and Glimmer templates**. "Similar to Vetur for Vue projects, Glint consists of a CLI (command-line interface) and a language server to provide feedback and enforce correctness both locally during editing and project-wide in CI (continuous integration)."

<img alt="" role="presentation" src="/images/blog/2020-03-26/glint-featured.png" />

To learn more why Glint was born and what you can do with Glint, we encourage you to have a look at the blog post, [Introducing: Glint, a typed-template solution for GlimmerX and Ember](https://www.salsify.com/blog/engineering/introducing-glint-a-typed-template-solution-for-glimmerx-and-ember). The blog post provides amazing screenshots and GIFs to demonstrate Glint in action.

Please thank the Typed Ember team, which consists of [Dan Freeman (@dfreeman)](https://github.com/dfreeman), [James Davis (@jamescdavis)](https://github.com/jamescdavis), and [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho), by trying out Glint today!
