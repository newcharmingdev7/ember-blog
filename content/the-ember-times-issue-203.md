👋 Emberistas! 🐹

Ember 4.6 Released 🔥,
eslint-plugin-ember 11.0 Released 🧹

## [Ember 4.6 Released 🔥](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-6-released)

Ember 4.6 was recently released! 🔥

This release included a few bug fixes for Ember.js, 1 deprecation for Ember CLI, and 9 bug fixes for Ember Data. The release also includes 8 deprecations for Ember Data and improvements to Ember Data's build size!

Head on over to the [4.6 release blog post](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-6-released) and give it a read today!

## [Plain Old Functions as Helpers 😎](https://blog.emberjs.com/plain-old-functions-as-helpers)

In case you missed it, there's a [new post](https://blog.emberjs.com/plain-old-functions-as-helpers) by [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) that covers a long-awaited feature that was released recently in Ember 4.5, plain old JavaScript functions as helpers! 😎

As the post indicates, this means two things today:

1. You can use (bound) methods on your backing class as helpers directly.
2. You can define function-based helpers without importing and using helper().

Also, in the future, there should be even better support when the <template> feature lands!

## [eslint-plugin-ember 11.0 Released 🧹](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v11.0.0)

[Bryan Mishkin (@bmish)](https://github.com/bmish) has released [v11.0.0](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v11.0.0) of [eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember). Aside from housekeeping, there's better support for ESLint v8 and one new recommended rule [no-array-prototype-extensions](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-array-prototype-extensions.md).

👋 If you would like to get involved with linting and open source, there are a lot of options for contributing:

* Suggest an idea for a new lint rule to catch a common mistake or enforce a best practice ([file new issue for eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/issues/new) or [file new issue for ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/issues/new))
* Implement a new lint rule (see [list of 25+ ideas for eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22New+Rule%22) or [list of 20+ ideas for ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22New+Rule%22))
* Implement an autofixer for an existing rule (see [list of 5+ ideas for eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/issues/1556) or [list of 10+ ideas for ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/issues/2571))
<!-- alex ignore just -->
* Even just tweaking the documentation for a rule or fixing a small bug can have an impact and is always appreciated!
