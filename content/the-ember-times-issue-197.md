👋 Emberistas! 🐹
First-Class Component Templates RFC in FCP 📖,

---

## [First-Class Component Templates RFC in FCP 📖](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/779)

[Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) who [recently joined](https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/1493295356368470019) the Ember Framework Core Team has the [RFC on First-Class Component Templates](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/779) in FCP! This follows his detailed blog series on [Ember Template Imports](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/).

The RFC proposes that we adopt `<template>` tags as a format for making component templates first-class participants in JavaScript and TypeScript with strict mode template semantics. As Chris mentions, doing so would help provide a number of new capabilities to Ember and Glimmer users:

- accessing local JavaScript values with no ceremony and no backing class, enabling much easier use of existing JavaScript ecosystem tools, including especially styling libraries—standard CSS Modules will “just work,” for example
- authoring more than one component in a single file, where colocation makes sense—and thereby providing more control over a component’s public API
- likewise authoring locally-scoped helpers, modifiers, and other JavaScript functionality

Go ahead and check out [the RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/779) on GitHub.
