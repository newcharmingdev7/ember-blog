## [RFC: Add Ember Cookbook 🍳](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/786)

[Ketaki Deo (@ketakideo)](https://github.com/ketakideo) opened an [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/786) to add a cookbook section to our learning resources that will help Ember developers to learn maintainable, accessible patterns for common tasks.

Today, the Ember docs are missing [how-to guides](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/) that would provide goal-oriented answers and patterns to common problems Ember developers face on a daily basis. This [used to be available in v1.12](https://guides.emberjs.com/v1.12.0/cookbook/) but was removed in v1.13.

These types of content exist today in the form of blogs, stackoverflow answers and efforts like [Ember Atlas](https://www.notion.so/emberatlas/The-Ember-Atlas-4094f81c86c34badb4a562ed29414ae1) but they are not discoverable and can sometimes be incorrect. The proposed Ember Cookbook will be managed and curated by the Ember Learning team which will work closely with the Ember Core team on upgrades to add, modify or delete information as needed.

Read, comment, and discuss this proposal in the [RFC on Github](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/786)!

## [Ember.js Triaging Office Hours 📚](https://discord.com/channels/@me/514450883774382122/936050318259662938)
  
[@locks](https://github.com/locks), a member of the [Framework and Learning core teams](https://emberjs.com/teams/) has started weekly office hours for anyone that was to help triage issues and pull requests on Ember core projects, like [ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/), [ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli), [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data), and many others.
If you want to learn how to reproduce bugs, learn how to figure out if issues are still relevant, or you want to help Ember keep their project tidy, join locks at the `#issue-triage` channel of Ember's Discord every [Thursday at 15h GMT](https://meetingzone.app/utc/thursday/1500).

## [Pass me the remote - meetup recordings about V2 addon format and teaching Ember 📹](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfj7cVutJgO1PT78syaRkLg)

With the new year and a new major version of Ember, remote events are in full swing, with recordings available so that Ember developers around the world can participate.

Earlier this month, the Boston Ember Community meetup gathered remotely to learn about V2 addon formats and how Ember is a great tool for teaching junior developers. Check out the videos!
