## [RFC: Add Ember Cookbook 🍳](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/786)

[Ketaki Deo (@ketakideo)](https://github.com/ketakideo) opened an [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/786) to add a cookbook section to our learning resources that will help Ember developers to learn maintainable, accessible patterns for common tasks.

Today, the Ember docs are missing [how-to guides](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/) that would provide goal-oriented answers and patterns to common problems Ember developers face on a daily basis. This [used to be available in v1.12](https://guides.emberjs.com/v1.12.0/cookbook/) but was removed in v1.13.

These types of content exist today in the form of blogs, stackoverflow answers and efforts like [Ember Atlas](https://www.notion.so/emberatlas/The-Ember-Atlas-4094f81c86c34badb4a562ed29414ae1) but they are not discoverable and can sometimes be incorrect. The proposed Ember Cookbook will be managed and curated by the Ember Learning team which will work closely with the Ember Core team on upgrades to add, modify or delete information as needed.

Read, comment, and discuss this proposal in the [RFC on Github](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/786)!
