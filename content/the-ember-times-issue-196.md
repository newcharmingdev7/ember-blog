## [Whiskey, Web and Whatnot with guest Chris Thoburn 🔊](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/discovering-ember-adopting-orbit-and-unlocking-optimization-with-chris-thoburn-runspired/)

[Robert Wagner (@rwwagner90)](https://github.com/rwwagner90) and [Chuck Carpenter (@chuckcarpenter)](https://github.com/chuckcarpenter) of Ship Shape sit down with [Chris Thoburn, A.K.A. Runspired, (@runspired)](https://github.com/runspired) in their latest [Whiskey, Web and Whatnot podcast episode](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/discovering-ember-adopting-orbit-and-unlocking-optimization-with-chris-thoburn-runspired/). Runspired elaborates on his initial difficulties in picking up Ember, as well as the discoveries that led him to sticking with this framework for the long haul. The trio also discuss the unique benefits of Orbit.js, why Runspired finds JSON:API and GraphQL to be a perfect match, and how Ember data cares about making data cacheable, but not necessarily how that data is structured within the cache.

## [Ember Ignite Reminder 🔥](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ember-ignite-tickets-232969998537)

This is an additional reminder for the Ember Ignite international virtual mini conference scheduled for Wednesday, February 23rd!

We mentioned this conference several issues back, but we're highlighting the event again as it's coming up soon.

Tickets are donation-based with a suggested amount of $30 USD. Proceeds will go towards creating an open source curriculum for teaching Ember to junior developers and taking a live cohort of 10 junior engineers (with no experience) and teaching them Ember so well, that they'll go toe-to-toe against mid-level UI engineer candidates. This effort is led by [Jai Bhagat](https://twitter.com/ChaiWithJai).

[Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ember-ignite-tickets-232969998537) today!
