## Ember Addon Roundup 🌎

We’ve had several addons across the Ember ecosystem release updates recently, here’s what you may have missed and reasons to upgrade!

- [Jon Kilroy (@jkusa)](https://github.com/jkusa) released [ember-arg-types v0.4.0](https://twitter.com/jonkilroy/status/1461089358338039815) which provides the **forbidExtraArgs** decorator for checking that only arguments with the `arg` decorator are provided to a component (useful for incorrect invocations).
- [Luke Miela (@lukemiela)](https://github.com/lukemelia) and [Sergey Astapov (@SergeAstapov)](https://github.com/SergeAstapov) released [ember-keyboard 7.0.0-beta.0](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-keyboard/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.0) which dropped deprecated features in the 6.x series.
- [Chris Manson (@mansona)](https://github.com/mansona) released the [first version of the ember-cli-addon-docs migrator](https://twitter.com/real_ate/status/1464596213781704713) named [ecad-migrator](https://github.com/empress/ecad-migrator) which helps move your documentation to [Field Guide](https://github.com/empress/field-guide).
- [Scott Newcomer (@snewcomer)](https://github.com/snewcomer) released [ember-sortable v3.0](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v300-2021-11-29) which removes the component version of the addon (only allows using the modifier version).
