## [Virtual EmberConf 2021 üî• üìº](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkc3vz8_N4xkeboowQcPQbK)

Heyo! Did you miss out on Virtual EmberConf 2021? Did you see some talks, but missed others? Did you watch all of the content, but want to re-watch things!? üëÄ Fear not, the suite of full conference talks can now be found online now as [individual videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkc3vz8_N4xkeboowQcPQbK).

If you didn't get a chance to see them, you shouldn't miss the [Keynote Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJPUQQQ9QDg&list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkc3vz8_N4xkeboowQcPQbK&index=10) and [Keynote Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z6cLV2licU&list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkc3vz8_N4xkeboowQcPQbK&index=11) by none other than our own [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats) and [Godfrey Chan (@chancancode)](https://github.com/chancancode).

## [Achieving a11y automation testing üé•](https://twitter.com/TestJSSummit/status/1369241608944762883)

If you're looking for some content in the wider JavaScript community beyond EmberConf, you can checkout the fantastic talk by [Ava Gaiety Wroten (@hergaiety)](https://github.com/hergaiety) at TestJS Summit covering [a11y automated testing](https://twitter.com/TestJSSummit/status/1369241608944762883)! üî•üî•üî•

The talk covers not only what Ember does for accessibility in testing, but also highlights some approaches and tools you can use for making automation a11y focused in other frameworks.

## [Serverless functions in Ember and Glimmer üíØ](https://shipshape.io/blog/serverless-functions-ember-glimmer/)

After using [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) in Next.js, [Jared Galanis (@jaredgalanis)](https://github.com/jaredgalanis) explored bringing the same functionality to Ember and Glimmer. Next's API routes are essentially node functions that deploy as serverless lambdas. They can provide a place to write a GraphQL endpoint, serve as a gateway to other APIs, or serve as a full-fledged backend that talks to a persistence layer.

The article walks through the setup of serverless functions in both Ember and Glimmer, using Netlify or Vercel. Check out Jared's blog post for [Ship Shape](https://shipshape.io/), [Serverless Functions in Ember and Glimmer](https://shipshape.io/blog/serverless-functions-ember-glimmer/) and try it out yourself for some developer experience gains on the frontend!
