## Virtual Ember Meetups 🐹

Have you been missing attending your local Ember meetup during the pandemic? Well you're in luck, there are a couple of virtual Ember meetups happening next week that you can attend.

1) If you've been wanting to learn more about what the Fastboot team is up to, you may want to check out the [online event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ember-fastboot-ssr-beyond-tickets-144468965565?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch) occurring on 4/14. There will be some great talks by members of Fastboot team, including appearances by [Dave Laird (@kiwiupover)](https://github.com/kiwiupover), [Suchita Doshi
 (@suchitadoshi1987)](https://github.com/suchitadoshi1987), [Thomas Wang
 (@xg-wang)](https://github.com/xg-wang) and [Scott Newcomer (@snewcomer)](https://github.com/snewcomer).

2) Haven't had your fill yet? The next day (4/15) you can come visit with Emberistas and Embereños from Los Angeles, and far and wide, for some more good Fastboot content and discussions on modifiers and components at the [Ember LA Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-LA/events/277245874)!
