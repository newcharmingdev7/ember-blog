## [Prettier for Handlebars support üôå](https://prettier.io/blog/2021/05/09/2.3.0.html#ember--handlebars)

Prettier can now officially format HTML templates with Handlebars (HBS) in the newly released [version 2.3.0](https://prettier.io/blog/2021/05/09/2.3.0.html#ember--handlebars). Thank you to [Cyrille David (@dcyriller)](https://github.com/dcyriller) for pushing this initiative, which started in 2017, through the finish line.

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. This removes all bikeshedding on what rules we should have or shouldn‚Äôt have and instead provides one standard for everyone to use by default.

In order to keep your project aligned with Prettier‚Äôs formatting we can use the Ember Template Lint plugin: [ember-template-lint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint-plugin-prettier). This plugin defines a _single rule_ that rule will compare your code with Prettier's output.

So try it out today by using the **glimmer parser** for Prettier!

## [Embroider: from zero to route splitting in 3.5 weeks üìù](https://dev.to/bendemboski/embroider-from-zero-to-route-splitting-in-3-5-weeks-5abo)

If you have been part of the Ember community for a while now and have read [The Ember Times' last issue](https://blog.emberjs.com/the-ember-times-issue-179#toc_readers-question-what%E2%80%99s-the-current-status-of-the-embroider-project-%F0%9F%A7%B5), you have probably heard about [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider). This project is currently at version 0.41.0 and usable in Ember projects.

[Ben Demboski (@bendemboski)](https://github.com/bendemboski) wrote this [blog](https://dev.to/bendemboski/embroider-from-zero-to-route-splitting-in-3-5-weeks-5abo) about how he implemented Embroider in a commercial, [`ember-electron`](https://ember-electron.js.org) app.

Ben's [blog post](https://dev.to/bendemboski/embroider-from-zero-to-route-splitting-in-3-5-weeks-5abo) explains in detail the app and the process used to make the app use Embroider. All the hard things he ran into, such as ES6 module compliance and third-party add-ons. Luckily, after 3.5 weeks, Ben achieved **tree-shaking** and **code splitting across routes**. So if you want to start taking advantage of what Embroider has to offer, this post is a great place to start.

If you read the blog, start with this project yourself and look for a place to get more help, check out the `#dev-embroider` channel on [Ember.JS Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs).

## [Ember takes the GAAD Pledge üòç](https://blog.emberjs.com/gaad-2021)
