## 🎤 EmberConf News

We know everyone is getting excited about EmberConf and you might be wondering when it's coming. We are working on getting our ducks in a row. After three years of virtual EmberConf we're working out a way to match everybodies expectations around a possible hybrid conference. In the mean time you can of course keep working on those proposals and we’ll release more details as soon as we can. Historically EmberConf has happend in March, but this time it will be later in the year. Hope to see you there!
